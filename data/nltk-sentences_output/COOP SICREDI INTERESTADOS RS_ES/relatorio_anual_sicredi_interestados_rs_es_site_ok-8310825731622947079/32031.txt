The winner of the last draw, a member for over 20 years, Cleberson Hubner Janke, from the city of Cristal, said he found out about the draw through his account manager: â€œShe went to my property and I wasn't there, she called me and said that I won R$100,000, I thought she was joking, she insisted and sent me a video showing the draw and my name appeared.
