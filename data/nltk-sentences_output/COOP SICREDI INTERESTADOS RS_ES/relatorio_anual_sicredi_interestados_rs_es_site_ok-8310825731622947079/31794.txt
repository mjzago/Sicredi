In 2021 We continue to work with the school network through the programs A União Faz a Vida, Cooperativas Escolares and Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis, encouraging our children to follow the paths of cooperativism, in addition to also dealing with financial education, a fundamental topic for the training of future citizens.
