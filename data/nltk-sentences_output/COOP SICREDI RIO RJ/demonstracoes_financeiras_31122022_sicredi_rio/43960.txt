For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: • The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the binding of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incur significant losses; and • The possibility that the institution will not be able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market.
