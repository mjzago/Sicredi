Deliberations at general assemblies, held in open voting unless otherwise decided by the assembly itself, will be taken by a simple majority, except with regard to matters falling within the exclusive competence of the extraordinary general assembly, for whose validity is required by the votes of 2/3 (two thirds) of the delegates present.
