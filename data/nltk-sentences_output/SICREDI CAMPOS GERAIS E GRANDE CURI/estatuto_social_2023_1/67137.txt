Deliberations at general assemblies, carried out by open vote unless otherwise decided by the assembly itself, will be taken by a simple majority, except regarding matters of exclusive competence of the extraordinary general assembly, for whose validity it is required in the votes of 2/3 (two thirds) of the delegates present.
