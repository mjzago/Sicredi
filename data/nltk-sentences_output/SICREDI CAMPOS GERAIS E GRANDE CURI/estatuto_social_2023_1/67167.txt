§ 3° The term of office will be 4 (four) years, with renewal of at least 1/3 (one third) of the members, observing that, if the calculation results in a fractional number, the immediately higher whole number must be considered, given that those elected will remain in office until the inauguration of their successors, allowing them, from the election, the full monitoring of the remaining participation of those who succeeded.
