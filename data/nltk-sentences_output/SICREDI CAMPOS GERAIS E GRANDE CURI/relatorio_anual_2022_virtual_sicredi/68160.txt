Upon the approval of the members at the meetings, with great honor and responsibility I will assume this role, counting on a qualified board of directors, and a competent board, formed in-house – Leila Grik as the new executive director, Reinaldo Oliveira as the new business director, Tilene Farina continuing as operations director – all imbued with the Sicredi Way of Being, so together, inspired by the symbol of cooperativism, represented by the two pine trees, social and economic, increasingly stronger and balanced, as contemporary cooperativism wants, we seek the better for our associates and communities.
