Even in a challenging year like the one we went through, we followed our purpose and We delivered four new branches to the communities where we operate, in the cities of Machado/MG, Poços de Caldas/MG, Erval Velho/SC and Concórdia/SC, which received a Business branch, becoming the third service point in the municipality.
