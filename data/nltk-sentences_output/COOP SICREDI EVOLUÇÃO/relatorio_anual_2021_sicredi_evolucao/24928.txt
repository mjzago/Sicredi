To support entrepreneurs, we offer our members the Emergency Renegotiation Line made possible by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development - BNDES, which allowed the renegotiation of installments without changing the original maturity of the operation and exceptionally in cases of operations with post-fixed rate (TLP) the possibility of extending the final term.
