At 6:00 pm, the table was once again composed, and after verifying the quorum, with the presence of 297 (two hundred and ninety and seven) associates, work resumed, at which time the President highlighted that the meeting was being recorded for record purposes, and he then informed again that the first and sixth items on the agenda had already been approved by the morning, with the election and proclamation of the new Board of Directors for the next four years and the Fiscal Council for the next two years, presenting to the plenary the names of those elected, who, as they were a single slate, were approved by acclamation, ratifying the election by those present, through a new symbolic acclamation via “chat”.
