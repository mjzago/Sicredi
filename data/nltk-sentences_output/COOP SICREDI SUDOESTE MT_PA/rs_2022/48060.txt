To support this program, we have a distributed structure â€“ with the coordination of actions being carried out by the Data Protection and Privacy management, located at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, and with responsible parties (in charge of data and their respective auxiliaries) in each entity of the System (single cooperatives, central and centralizing entities) for the adjustments of their activities.
