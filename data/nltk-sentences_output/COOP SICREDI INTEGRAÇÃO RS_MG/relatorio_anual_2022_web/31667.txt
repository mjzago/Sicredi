C Day (Cooperate Day) is always celebrated on the first Saturday of July - International Cooperative Day -, and in 2022 it mobilized dozens of Sicredi Integração RS/MG employees in charitable activities inspired by the theme “simple attitudes move the world”, demonstrating the strength of cooperativism in favor of social transformations.
