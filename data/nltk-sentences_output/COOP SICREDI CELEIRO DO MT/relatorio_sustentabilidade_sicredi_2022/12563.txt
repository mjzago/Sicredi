To support this program, we have a structure distributed â€“ with the coordination of actions being carried out by the Data Protection and Privacy management, located at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, and with those responsible (data managers and their respective assistants) in each entity of the System (single cooperatives, central and centralizing entities) for the adjustments of their activities.
