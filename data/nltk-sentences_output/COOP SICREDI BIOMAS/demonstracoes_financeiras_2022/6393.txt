In this spirit of bringing activities aimed at sustainability, in 2022 we adopted two specific actions at Sicredi Biomas branches: card stamps at branches in Araputanga, Pontes and Lacerda (Buriti), Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco (Aquiri), and the delivery of fruit tree seedlings to members at Commodore agencies and Caba√ßal Reserve.
