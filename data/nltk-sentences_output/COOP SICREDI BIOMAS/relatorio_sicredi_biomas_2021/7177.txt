For us, being increasingly closer to our members is of utmost importance, which is why we adopted and maintained throughout 2021 projects that bring the C ooperative closer to the community, such as the President's Table, a moment for group coordinators at meetings of the Board of Directors, the Cooperative Chat and the Assembly, which demonstrate that our desire is to listen and understand the needs of our members, so that together we can achieve even more impactful results.
