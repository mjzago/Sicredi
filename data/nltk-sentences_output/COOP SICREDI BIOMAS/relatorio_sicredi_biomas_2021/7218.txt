For us, being increasingly closer to our associates is of utmost importance, which is why we adopted and maintained During 2021, projects that bring the Cooperative closer to the community, such as the President's Table, a moment for nucleus coordinators at Board of Directors meetings, the Cooperative Chat and the Assembly, which demonstrate that our desire is to listen and gathering the needs of our associates, so that together we can achieve even more impactful results.
