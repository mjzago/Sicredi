For us, being increasingly closer to our members is extremely important, which is why we adopted and maintained throughout 2021 projects that bring the Cooperative closer to the community, such as the President's Table, a moment for nucleus coordinators at Council meetings of Administration, the Cooperative Chat and the Assembly, which demonstrate that our desire is to listen and understand the needs of our associates, so that together we can achieve even more impactful results.
