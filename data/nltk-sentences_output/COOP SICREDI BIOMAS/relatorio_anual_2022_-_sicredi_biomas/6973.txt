In this sense, throughout the year we maintained projects that bring Sicredi Biomas closer to the community, such as the President's Table, the Cooperative Chat, the participation of the coordinators of the monthly meetings of the Board of Directors (CONSAD) and the Assembly, which demonstrate that our desire is to listen and welcome the needs of our members, so that together we can achieve even more satisfactory results.
