Thanks to this partnership with Sicredi, a cooperative of which we have been partners since its founding in 1989 Santo Augusto/RS, we were able to build this work with more than 6,000 mÂ², which has capacity for 240 animals, with a milking room, fans, feeding lanes, automated cleaning, as well as coolers.
