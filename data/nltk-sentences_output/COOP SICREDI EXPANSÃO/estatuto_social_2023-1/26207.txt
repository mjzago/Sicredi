The General Assembly will normally be convened and chaired by the President of the Board of Directors, and may also be called by the Board of Directors or the Fiscal Council, if there are serious or urgent reasons, or by 1/5 (one fifth) of the delegates in full enjoyment of their social rights after a request not met by the Board of Directors.
