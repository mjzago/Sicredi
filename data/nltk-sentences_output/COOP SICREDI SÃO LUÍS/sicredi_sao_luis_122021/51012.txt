To support entrepreneurs, we offer our members the Emergency Renegotiation Line made possible by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development - BNDES, which made it possible to renegotiate installments without changing the original maturity of the operation and exceptionally in cases of operations with post-fixed rates ( TLP) the possibility of extension of the deadline.
