§ 3 The term of office will be 4 (four) years, with renewal of at least 1/3 (one third) of the members, observing that, if the calculation results in a fractional number, the whole number must be considered immediately superior, and those elected will remain in office until the successors take office, allowing them, from the election, to fully monitor the remaining participation of those succeeded.
