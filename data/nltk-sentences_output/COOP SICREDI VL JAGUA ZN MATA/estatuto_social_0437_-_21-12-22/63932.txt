Deliberations at general assemblies, held by open vote unless otherwise decided by the assembly itself, will be taken by a simple majority, except when to matters of exclusive competence of the extraordinary general assembly, for the validity of which the votes of 2/3 (two thirds) of the delegates present are required.
