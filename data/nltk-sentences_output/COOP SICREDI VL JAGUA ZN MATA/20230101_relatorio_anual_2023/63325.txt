To all of us, advisors, coordinators, directors and collaborators responsible for the governance and management of Sicr edi Vale do Jaguari and Zona da Mata RS/MG, we just want to thank all of you because we went through two years of pandemic where we were all affected, we lost friends and family, and all of you remained committed to our cooperative, bringing your resources to us to manage, allowing us to continue growing sustainably well above the growth of the Brazilian banking system.
