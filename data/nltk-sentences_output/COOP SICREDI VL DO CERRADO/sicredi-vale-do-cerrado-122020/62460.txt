The main changes implemented were: the Balance Sheet accounts are presented in order of liquidity and liability and are no longer segregated into Current and Non-Current, with the segregation presented only in the Explanatory Note; balances in the Balance Sheet for the period are presented in comparison with the end of the immediately previous fiscal year and the other statements are compared with the same periods of the previous year.
