The year was also marked by structuring and improvements in our management and governance aiming at sustainability in our business: we promoted the constitution of the third board of directors of the cooperative (Business Board) and regional management in Mato Grosso and Amazonas; we expanded the work structure of our agencies and headquarters; we started the “Transformative Leadership” Program with the training of 49 trainee leaders; we implemented technical committees on the board of directors; we work on improving communication with the membership and government through the “Conexão Vale do Cerrado” and, during the year, we held meetings with Center Coordinators in all our municipalities.
