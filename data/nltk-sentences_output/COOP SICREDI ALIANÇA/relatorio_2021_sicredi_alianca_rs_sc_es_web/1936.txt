We invested in a rainwater reuse system, with storage in cisterns for garden irrigation; we implemented the photovoltaic solar energy generation system; we opted for glass and solar shades to control the building’s temperature – reducing the thermal load by 30%; we chose the VRF system for air conditioning, with lower energy consumption; and we prioritize the use of LED lamps.
