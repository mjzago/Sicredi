We resume the construction of our new Integração agency, which will be inaugurated next April, we maintained our social actions, such as support for Funase inmates, support for Ágape, which works to recover drug addicts, we started supporting NGOs that care for the elderly and provide assistance to stray domestic animals, and we donated lots of basic food baskets.
