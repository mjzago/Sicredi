In 2021, we implemented the Conexão GTR Project, created from the idea of ​​the associate and leader of the Youth Committee, Giovana Portolese, which aims to promote complementary training in the education of young people between 15 and 16 years old, helping to guide and direct their careers and generating opportunities to absorb talent local.The program had its first pilot initiative in the municipality of Cambará/PR and impacted the entire community, with 40 students enrolled, 14 participants and nine of them selected for internship positions in the project's partner companies.
