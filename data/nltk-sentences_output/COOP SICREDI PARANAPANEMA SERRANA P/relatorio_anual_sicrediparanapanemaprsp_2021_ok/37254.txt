In support of regional recyclers, organized or not in associations and cooperatives, we created the “Quem Coopera Recicla” Project, with the aim of providing better working conditions, promoting increased income, offering training for empowerment, entrepreneurship and financial education, and raising people's awareness of the importance from recycling to the sustainability of cities and communities.
