In 2021, we implemented the Sicredi + Sa√∫de Project to our employees, with lectures on mind and body care and the 1st Sicredi Running Challenge, which encouraged more than 250 employees to challenge themselves with walking and running practices for a healthier life, awakening their view of themselves in different ways , leading to a willingness to enjoy more family time, productivity in everyday life and, above all, an improvement in quality of life.
