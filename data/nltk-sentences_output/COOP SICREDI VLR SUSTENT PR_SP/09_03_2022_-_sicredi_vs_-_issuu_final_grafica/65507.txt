DAIANE PEREIRA SOARES Secretary of Education of the Municipality of Ivaiporã I always say that the municipality of Borrazópolis was very happy to establish a partnership with Sicredi, joining the A União faz a Vida Program and one of Patrícia's speeches in the presentation of the program that caught my attention was “teachers should be part of the program of their own free will and that it shouldn't be something imposed” and that was something different, because whenever companies offer us programs or projects, they want teacher participation to be massive and it doesn't always give satisfactory results.
