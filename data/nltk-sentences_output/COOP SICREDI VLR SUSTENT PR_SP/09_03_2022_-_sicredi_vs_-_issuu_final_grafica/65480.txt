*Associação Aliança Empreendedora is a non-profit organization, entitled OSCIP (Civil Society Organization of Public Interest) It was a great joy to be invited to participate in the Empreenda Project, without a doubt it was of great value, it was very important and it was learning that at the same time is basic, is extremely necessary to run a trade, a business and it really was very important and helped to open the mind and rethinking some attitudes in commerce, from controlling the trust to organizing the profit margin and it made us rethink some attitudes to improve and so it is something that will be marked in my mind and it really was very helpful in restructuring my business.
