With the União faz a Vida program, we notice that each year the number of teachers interested in being part of the program increases because they see that it is something that gives results and those who benefit from it, besides the teachers, are the students who are served with these projects, last year when we had the formation of the Cooperation project in Ponta do Lápis, we had the option of joining the training for financial education offered by the Central Bank, however, we opted for the training offered by Sicredi, through the program A União faz a Vida through Sicredi professionals and Professor Cássio, because we already know the acceptance that teachers have towards him.
