Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, the Amstad Savings and Loans Bank, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petr√≥polis, in Rio Grande do Sul, who started a cooperative enterprise that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country.
