Deliberations at general assemblies, held by open vote unless otherwise decided by the assembly itself, will be taken by a simple majority, except regarding matters falling within the exclusive competence of the general assembly extraordinary, for which the votes of 2/3 (two thirds) of the delegates present are required.
