We promote the local economy understanding that through our virtuous financial cycle we enable the generation of income, increase purchasing power and positively impact the locations where we operate, not only with financial products and services with the benefits of credit cooperatives, but also offering programs developed by Sicredi Cear√°, such as training in financial education and social assistance actions.
