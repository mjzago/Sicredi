In the development of the project “Bees don’t do harm, bees make honey”, developed by Lucas' class, the students learned about bees, honey production and received guidance on creating their own baits and thus capturing and breeding Jataí bees, a honey-producing species that does not have a sting and is therefore harmless and can be created by anyone.
