In 2021, we placed our flag in the State of Espírito Santo, with the opening of three branches in December, one in Marataízes and two in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, in addition to a business office, which had already been installed in September at the Commercial, Industrial and Services Association of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim (ACISCI), in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, and the provision of a mobile agency for circulation in specific actions in both municipalities, generating greater proximity to the communities.
