Ivo reports that he had the pleasure of following the growth and development of Sicredi in the region since the 1970s and developed a fondness for cooperativism: “I see that the cooperative process has a great advantage, as it seeks out members who have available resources, applications It is investments in the Cooperative, which uses this same resource to pass on to other members to manage their businesses, finance their crops, construction projects, industry, working capital... One helps the other”.
