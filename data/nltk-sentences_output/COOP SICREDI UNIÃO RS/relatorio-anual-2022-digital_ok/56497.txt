The Social Fund is part of the Cooperative's Strategic Planning and was created with the aim of supporting local projects of collective interest, where part of the Cooperative's results, that is, 2.5% of the previous year, is allocated to the Social Fund (after payment of interest to the capital and allocation of the reserve fund of loss amounts recovered from previous years) and directed to non-profit entities that carry out the difference in people's lives.
