The Social Fund is part of the Cooperative's Strategic Planning and was created with the aim of supporting local projects of collective interest, where part of the Cooperative's result, that is, 2.5% of the previous year, is allocated to Social Fund (after payment of interest on capital and allocation of lost amounts recovered from previous years to the reserve fund), contributing to non-profit entities that make a difference in people's lives.
