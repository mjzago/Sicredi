For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: • The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from binding of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring signiﬁcant losses; and • The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally transacted or due to some discontinuity in the market.
