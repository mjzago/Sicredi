Aiming to expand the positive impact of the Program, we launched the Sicredi Financial Education Fair, which was created with the purpose of being a large permanent national movement, with all our cooperatives mobilized throughout the year to bring financial education to their members, employees and communities , promoting activations in different sizes and formats.
