The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the Cash Flows, the following amounts were considered as cash and cash equivalents: 2016 2015Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing assets and liabilities Contingent assets are embodied in CMN Resolution No. 3,535/08, namely: Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those classified as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. p) Accounting estimatesStated by known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro-rata basis per day incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. n) Taxes and contributions Provisions for Income Tax, Social Contribution, Social Integration Program - PIS and Contribution for Social Security Financing - COFINS were calculated at current rates, considering, for the respective calculation bases, the legislation relevant to each tax. Cooperatives are subject to Income Tax and Social Contribution when they achieve positive results in non-cooperative activities. In these cases, the provision is constituted based on the rates in force, considering additions and exclusions and the offset of tax losses and negative CSLL basis limited to 30% of taxable profit. o) Contingent Assets and LiabilitiesAssets are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset. l) Term deposits These are stated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. m) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current)(i) The item refers to amounts receivable from credit card transactions.
