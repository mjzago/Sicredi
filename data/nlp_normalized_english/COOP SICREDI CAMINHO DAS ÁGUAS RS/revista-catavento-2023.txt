The cooperative, through the capture of time deposits and savings, reached the figure of 1 billion reais raised. This value is used to offer more credit to members who want to develop their businesses in the region, promoting the development of municipalities and of people, making a virtuous circle. In terms of investment, the cooperative increased the number of members with programmed investments by 16%, supporting financial education to realize a dream or some unforeseen event. Of the new members, more than 26% already join the cooperative with this potential unlocked. The credibility of investing together with the cooperative meant that the Sicredi System gained its high corporate rating from Moody’s Local.

Personal credit was granted for vehicles, solar panels, agricultural credit, working capital and much more.

CPR Fácil is the first agro credit product that can be issued completely digitally. It is easy to use by members and operation by the cooperative is simple. “This product was a success”, comments Felipe Arthur Flesch. For Flesch, before releasing people's potential we need to release our own potential, and this year it was remarkable how team development. “I’m very happy to see people’s progress. Our team is even more prepared to build an extraordinary 2023 together”, he adds.

Festival Teal 26 27Revista Catavento 2023 Revista Catavento 2023Formal positions as known in a ﬁnancial institution no longer make sense in the cooperative, employees will now have roles and in them, a purpose and responsibilities, including being able to assume more than one role at the same time. In this way, with autonomy to change or adapt everything that is under your responsibility or propose changes in what you deem necessary, the power of another role will be distributed more horizontally and decisions will be faster and more conscious.Meeting with the guardians of good experience and business facilitators to present the organizational design proposal for the cooperativePilot meetings mediated by Henry Goldsmid and Ravi Resck consultants who are supporting the implementation of organizational designIn the traditional hierarchical model, there are more people executing than thinking, sometimes the one who plans and requests the execution has little understanding of reality and the process ends up falling apart making it more time-consuming and even inefficient. Self-management as a management model is already a subject addressed in the cooperative, and presupposes that employees do part of the decisions and their opinions are heard and taken into consideration, thus flattening the business organization chart and making management happen in a horizontal way, where everyone has freedom and responsibility to think, propose and act. What changes in practice for our associates? A faster, more agile and assertive service, where the employee who has direct relationship contact can make decisions and support the member. Organizational Design is a process of design, define and adapt the structure of an organization. For the cooperative, design comes to improve and organize what was already happening, autonomy now begins to have a form, agreements and practices described for everyone. With the support of a specialized consultancy, Interser, the implementation of this new organizational model provides a clearer view of who The implementation process is taking place in the cooperative and two pilot agencies, Três Coroas and Taquara, are already putting into practice the structuring proposed by the consultancy. The Guardian of Good Experience at the Taquara Agency, Andreza Bernardo says that the roles are starting to become clearer, which is in the decision-making process for each role that does not need to involve others, so decision-making becomes faster, “we started to create projects (internal campaigns) in the agency circle, dealing with what is important to the circle”. For 2023, the results of the pilots will be evaluated, to extend this structure to other agencies and Superintendency areas. However, the structures of the cooperative are not structured so that employee autonomy is fully achieved. Inconsistencies were emerging and restructuring was becoming increasingly necessary so that Sicredi Caminho das Águas could move forward with more certainty and speed. The year 2022 was marked by many events and changes, practices that did not make sense left existing, new ways of looking at the relationship with the member and the business are being implemented, among them, the beginning of the cooperative's organizational design journey. will be responsible for each activity, the limits of authority that each employee will have, free flow of information, improvements in processes being carried out by everyone, and meetings between more objective employees, thus creating a more collaborative environment, where different perspectives will contribute to avoiding inefficient work and more dynamic structures that are easier to adapt.

Sicredi Caminho das Águas began redefining its goals, replacing targets, rankings and competition with metrics so that employees can monitor their performance, without the need for offering products that do not make sense to the member. Our purpose of unlocking the potential of people and businesses encourages us to put our products at the service of the community, discovering how we can contribute to people's happiness and doing everything in our power to make this happen. Placing the member at the center means listening to them to discover what is best for them, connecting with what is best for the cooperative and the community. understand it and offering the best solution to support their needs, often helping them discover what they need, is genuinely focusing on the member. We believe that this is how we will reach the next 100 years!

Cuca and coffee make this process even more relaxed and productive. In 2022, another moment of meeting with employees was created. The Synergizing moment invites everyone to meet once a month online with connection and energy to celebrate achievements, share news and align expectations. In Charles Chaplin's classic film, Modern Times is portrayed in a comical but quite realistic way, as in During the industrial revolution, working hours and activities in factories operated. Command and control, mechanized tasks, unmotivated employees and being treated like cogs in an immense machine: the portrait of the orange organizations described by Frederic Laloux in his work Reinventing Organizations. In it, the author presents a more assertive and transformative way of managing companies, based on evolutionary purpose, self-management and integrality that he calls Teal organization. Sicredi Caminho das Águas is building in its evolutionary culture the opposite of what is portrayed in the film, and a journey towards a Teal organization presented by Laloux. In the cooperative, business goes far beyond profit, it needs to have meaning for the member and for the cooperative, so that they can release the potential of their business, make their enterprise sustainable, be able to realize their dreams and build their future and sleep peacefully in this process knowing that you were offered the best solution and with the best possible conditions. The municipality of Rolante, the headquarters city of Sicredi Caminho das Águas, is today considered the National Capital of Cuca and the delicacy is present in all festivities, meetings and coffees with increasingly special and surprising flavors. Connecting then, the cuca, which is a symbol of our headquarters city, and the cuca with the meaning of brain or mind, the cooperative created a moment of encounter with our colleagues from the agency and the executive director and Farol da Cultura, Sherlei Zucchetti, who was named “Cuca Aberta”. For this visit, one or two cucas are brought as a gift to the team. Cuca Aberta is a time for dialogue about culture, environment and much more. What differentiates this meeting from others that already exist in the cooperative is that the agenda is free. With this correlation and play on the term cuca, the meeting has more lightness and humor, but that doesn't mean it stops being complex, deep and very productive, expanding awareness, bringing understanding, learning and connections. It was 8 months of many meetings, conversations, laughter and created analogies. There were more than 50 caves and endless new discoveries. There were 28 meetings in 25 agencies and 3 with colleagues from headquarters. More than 300 employees were impacted by in-depth and productive conversations, washed down with many personalized coffee cups for the moment and many kilometers driven to get everything done to happen. Sherlei Zucchetti, executive director and Lighthouse of culture that guides the moments, exemplifies the meaning of these meetings, “just as the cuca, after being opened, cut and consumed, cannot return to its original form, our mind, after being enlarged, will not return to its original form. equal and from this, new and powerful learning and connections can be created and enhanced. And the best thing about it all is that everyone is invited to be part of it.” Evolutionary Culture - Environment 30 31Revista Catavento 2023 Revista Catavento 2023Timeline One year of Mobile Agency, bringing Sicredi to everyone. p12 100 years making a difference in communities. p14 First solar plant opens. p18In 2022 we opened 4 branches, further expanding our presence in the region, bringing more meaning and purpose to the community. p10
