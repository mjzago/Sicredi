The pandemic has taught us a lot, especially the importance of having alternative services for our associates, to always be close, to be active and relevant to the development of communities. The year 2022 was very important for the Cooperative and marks the full resumption of our activities, making it possible to work with our close service model, both in person and online. Today, for S icredi and our executive board, it is the associate who chooses the way he wants to be served. We have agile and intuitive channels and we will never let of having our agencies close and comfortable to welcome them. Studies prove: “cities that have the presence of cooperatives, have economic and social gains”, and that is what we work for, to be even closer to the communities in our area of ​​action, vigilant in what can bring more development and good common. In this sense, we expanded the area and actions of our relationship and educational programs. We believe that this model and proposal for Sicredi's work has been successful, as our Cooperative, in particular, has delivered, each year, a more significant value in member participation. In 10 years, we returned to our members: R$52.7 million in interest on capital, R$11.7 million in surplus capital and R$30.5 million in surplus in the current account. Furthermore, since the emergence of the Social Fund in 2016, R$2.5 million has already been invested in local projects. Another strong project that has been the focus of Our Executive Board is the continuity of expansion in the state of Espírito Santo. We plan to open 4 more branches by the end of 2023. New employees are already working on presenting our business model, offering our products and services to new members. In addition to the projection in ES, we aim to increase the number of service points in the Southern Region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where the Cooperative has been operating since April 1985. An example of this initiative is the establishment of business offices. In both regions, our challenge will be to offer our business model to the community, seeking the sustainable growth of the Cooperative to meet the needs of our members. Our strategic planning, always based on systemic drivers, places the associate at the center of all our decisions and initiatives, valuing the sustainability of our business with the expansion of positive impact in the economy, society and the environment. Therefore, we take care to restructure the areas of our Administrative Headquarters, also investing in areas such as innovation, automation, strategic monitoring and digital service, increasingly offering support to branch employees in providing services to members. As a characteristic of our business model: transparency is one of our values! So, in this report it is possible to identify our provision of accounts.

A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present.Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. 7 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES20228A great honor for Sicredi Interestados, to be part of the history of the first Credit Cooperative, founded by Theodor Ams tad, in 1902. Here we operate together with gauchos and capixabas for over 37 years, helping to develop the cities in our area of ​​action, and taking the purpose of cooperativism forward. Arlindo Holz Vice-President Sicredi Interados RS/ES Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova P etropolis (RS), the Father joined forces with 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From Camp arrived in cities, maintaining over time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promoting quality of life.

Find out more about our history in the publication A Trajetória do Sicr edi: https://www.sicredi.com.br/trajetoria/ 10 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTED RS/ES2022120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM 1Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a mandatory salary account to their employees, in a credit cooperative the agreement happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperation works, everyone can freely choose whether associate or not. 2Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in the assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM That were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and that govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the demands society of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact: 11 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES20223Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the results of operations generated by the money invested by members return to their pockets, as decided in a democratic way in the assemblies. 4Autonomy and independence The cooperative is totally autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model.5Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate pr roughness. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. These are examples of this The School Cooperative Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Grow and Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their community. THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advancement of the Industrial Revolution in the country . This scenario It brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other craftsmen got together and founded the Rochdale Society of Pioneering Provosts (Rochdale Quitable Pioneer s Societ y Limited). Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and union of efforts, provide a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped to open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where the responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives by understanding what values ​​and principles are necessary to an enterprise grows and maintains its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved. 12 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES20227Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members contract in the cooperative brings a result for the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region. 6Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. S icredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members. 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM Our cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM By playing our active role of associates, acting As business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes an offer of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that stimulates investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. 13 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES2022“Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good” As can be seen, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — had already been present since the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. 14 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES2022 A sentence by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperatives in Brazil, summarizes this view: COOPERATIVA NUMBERS 338 employees 1.7 billion credit portfolio 91 thousand members 15 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES202202 Our Cooperative 1816 17 2220 Time Line 16 COOPERATIVA SICREDI INTERESTADOS RS/ES2022OUR COOPERATIVE Mission How Cooperative system, valuing relationships, offering financial solutions to add income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society.
