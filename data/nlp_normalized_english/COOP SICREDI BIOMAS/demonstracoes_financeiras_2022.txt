50 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS #Classification of information: Internal UseCredit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Northwest of Mato Grosso, Acre and Amazonas - Sicredi Biomas Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Accounting and Tax Management ConfederationExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendence of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 51 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022MANAGEMENT REPORT Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. ECONOMIC SCENARIO In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, data on inflation already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increased credit and rising prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society52 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE BELIEVE WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE PROSPEROUS SOCIETY “We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and with the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: “ “ - Expansion to Acre and Amazonas: Since 2015, Sicredi Biomas has been growing with the expansion project, both for associates and territory. In 2022, 2 more agencies were opened in Acre (Tarauacá and Senador Guiomard) and 1 agency in Amazonas (Boca do Acre). - Reopening of facilities at the Vila Bela da Santissima Trindade, Jauru and Indiavaí agencies, all in the state of Mato Grosso. - Implementation of Recycling ATMs in 22 branches: with the aim of optimizing time in deposit and withdrawal transactions for members. - Together Let's Go Campaign: where the cooperative encouraged members and non-members to make financial investments in Social Capital, Savings and Fixed Income. In addition to the objective of raising funds to expand the portfolio of credit, the cooperative sought to encourage financial education in the communities where it operates. In total, the campaign was widely publicized by the cooperative's 28 agencies, in the states of Acre, Amazonas and Mato Grosso, during the period from 01/28/20222 to 06/30/2022. - Credit card annual fee exemption: with the aim of encouraging the use of credit cards by members - Green light fair - vehicle, motorcycle and solar energy campaign: In order to promote opportunities and accessible conditions for our members, contributing to the realization of dreams, and generating greater sustainability in our society, a FAIR FAIR was held to finance solar energy, motorcycles and automobiles. Between the periods from 10/17/2022 to 12/31/2022.53 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022- Working capital campaign: In order to generate financial sustainability in our community, provide a better user experience and support legal entity members of Cooperativa Biomas, a campaign was carried out to offer a working capital product at the right time to finance thirteenth salary expenses, stock renewal, purchase of raw materials and goods, as well as payment of suppliers, ultimately meeting member's business needs. - ROJECT PROJECT: aims to execute a technical assistance and rural extension program for rural and/or agro-industrial enterprises and prepare projects and proposals to obtain financial support through financing to be carried out by Sicredi Biomas, in all agencies in its area of ​​activity, with the aim of supporting collective or individual actions to add value, optimize family work, use of technologies and access to markets for family farming products.” “- MORE MICROCREDIT Line: Objective to increase the spread of credit within portfolios and agencies, aiming to provide access to members who have not yet been attended to and unassisted by other financial institutions, proposing to strengthen and promote the economy of the community where we operate. It is a small-value loan aimed at PF I, PF II, micro-entrepreneurs and its main purposes are to generate income, work and consumption. - REAL ESTATE CREDIT PORTABILITY: Real estate financing portability is the transfer of debt from one financial institution to another. The member who chooses This type of credit seeks more advantageous real estate financing conditions in relation to the original contract from another financial institution. Our first real estate loan portability took place on 12/15/2022 at the Guaporé branch - Pontes e Lacerda.” WE VALUE PEOPLE AND DIVERSITY Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: “- The Union Makes Life Program: It is Sicredi's main social responsibility program that, through its own project methodology, develops the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship in public and private schools in 19 cities in the Cooperative's area of ​​operation, positively impacting more than 1,400 teachers and more than 15 thousand students.54 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis - Financial Education: Fulfilling Sicredi's mission and following one of the principles of cooperativism, Sicredi Biomas has developed, over the years, the Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis, aimed at Financial Education. The program teaches members (and non-members) how to maintain a healthy financial life. In this way, the cooperative contributes to the construction of an increasingly financially sustainable community. More than 14 thousand people were trained by the program in 2022. - Crescer Program: The main objective of the Crescer program is to disseminate the knowledge about cooperativism and Sicredi, creating commitment and forming a support base for the continuity of cooperative business. In 2022, Sicredi Biomas trained more than 12 thousand people with the Program. - It's from the Heart, it's Cooperation - Day C: The joint campaigns aim, through the values ​​of cooperativism and volunteering, to bring sensitivity and lightness, but also to take a position to educate the community about what cooperativism is and how we practice in our daily lives, with a proprietary discourse created specifically for the cooperative through voluntary actions such as donating food, clothes, toys, etc. - Social Fund: In 2022, Sicredi Biomas served more than 70 entities and projects in our area of ​​activity in MT, AC and AM. Almost 1 million were invested to purchase various items such as wheelchairs, biosafety materials, basic and personal hygiene baskets, as well as other items. Several Entities such as APAEs, Rotarys, Lions, Children's Homes and Homes for the Elderly were assisted with the Social Fund. - Future Marathon: In October 2021, Sicredi Biomas held the first stage of the Future Marathon in Acre. Inspired by Hackathon models, the Marathon wanted to solve two common problems in Acre: lack of selective waste collection in Rio Branco and the spread of cooperativism in the state. In total, 17 teams signed up and competed for sponsorship worth 50 thousand reais for execution of the winning project. In 2022, the second stage was carried out with the realization of the first project, a cooperative fair at Shopping de Rio Branco – AC, Expocoop, which had the participation of more than 700 people.”55 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022“- Partnership with Sebrae: Demoday 2022, an event organized by Sebrae/Acre that provided and promoted business meetings between companies and investors in Acre, with the aim of presenting innovative solutions and creative ideas to contribute to resolution of projects in the state. During Demoday, 11 startups participating in the SebraeLab/Ufac Pre-Acceleration Program and 31 in the Inova Amazônia Acceleration Program met at SebraeLab, at the Federal University of Acre (Ufac), around the challenge of exchanging information and experiences to promote the growth of companies. This number is five times higher than that recorded in previous editions. - EcoBiomas Movement Campaign: set of actions we take to highlight socio-environmental issues, using information from the Sicredi System sustainability report and the specific actions that the Cooperative promotes. In this spirit of bringing activities aimed at sustainability, in 2022 we adopted two specific actions at Sicredi Biomas branches: card stamps at branches in Araputanga, Pontes and Lacerda (Buriti), Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco (Aquiri), and the delivery of fruit tree seedlings to members at Commodore agencies and Cabaçal Reserve. “ RECOGNITION “For more than 10 years, we have been included in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Você S/A Magazine, Central Bank and BNDES rankings.

It is stated at cost values ​​and includes expenses on the acquisition and development of software, adjusted by accumulated amortizations, calculated from the moment in which the respective benefits begin to be enjoyed, based on annual rates that take into account the economic useful life of the assets, in accordance with the provisions of CMN Resolution nº 4,534/16 and CPC 04-Intangible Assets, as mentioned in the Note "Use and intangible fixed assets". Accumulated amortizations, calculated from the moment the respective benefits begin to be enjoyed, at a rate of 10% to 20% per year, using the straight-line method. m) Reduction in the recoverable value of assets Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including assets intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset. Estimates Accounting values ​​are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of its determination. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constituting a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for tax, civil, tax and labor demands through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of disbursements by the entity to Each procedural element may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the value recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measuring the effects arising from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: The Administration monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, credit risk behavior dosages, the risks of the market and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts arising from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, passed in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the result positive in uncooperative mats. The provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 16%, in compliance with Provisional Measure No. 1,115, published on April 29, 2022, which increased the rate by one percentage point and taking effect during the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the offset of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation base from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of taxable profit. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation , such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the incidence of the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated based on revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. Income arising from operations carried out with members is tax-free. q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Centralização financeira                                                                                    81.908                                                                                  136.053  Total                                                                                 493.582                                                                                  278.666 Disponibilidades                                                                                    23.503 12,799 Shares of fixed income and multimarket funds - financial centralization (Note 06) 388,171 129,814 The financial statements are expressed in reais (R$), which is the Cooperative's functional currency, unless otherwise indicated, in thousands of reais ( R$ thousand). t) Recurring and non-recurring results Results Recurring results are those related to the Cooperative's characteristic activities that occur frequently in the present and are expected to occur in the future, while non-recurring results are those that arise from an extraordinary and/or unpredictable event, with a tendency not to be repeated in the future.

The market value of rural producer banknotes (CPR) is measured based on the interest curve, based on the rates negotiated in the B3day DI futures market and the credit spreads obtained through the premium risk established for the counterparty of the operation. CPR operations are carried out with members as long as they are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee instrument, considering the joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system to define a single spread for all counterparties. Fund shares are valued daily, through the share value, published by the fund administrator on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM and Brazilian Association of Investment Entities.

The market value of rural producer banknotes (CPR) is measured based on the interest curve, based on the rates negotiated in the B3day DI futures market and the credit spreads obtained through the premium risk established for the counterparty of the operation. CPR operations are carried out with members as long as they are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee instrument, considering the joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system to define a single spread for all counterparties.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 C onjunto A - Block A 1st floor - room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF Brazil T el: +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.br88 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be significantly distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to substantiate our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.89 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022  We obtained understanding internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative’s internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the ability to operational continuity of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer continue as a going concern. operational.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any deficiencies significant differences in the internal controls that we identified during our work.
