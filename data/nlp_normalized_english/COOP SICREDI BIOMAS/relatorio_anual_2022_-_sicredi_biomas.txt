We act in communities offering more than 300 financial products and services that meet the needs of our members and cities, promoting fair and sustainable development. That is our purpose. 4 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022In 2022 we reinforce the importance of the contribution of our members so that our Cooperative is increasingly prosperous. In this sense, throughout the year we maintained projects that bring Sicredi Biomas closer to the community, such as the President's Table, the Cooperative Chat, the participation of the coordinators of the monthly meetings of the Board of Directors (CONSAD) and the Assembly, which demonstrate that our desire is to listen and welcome the needs of our members, so that together we can achieve even more satisfactory results. On the next pages you will see how we can contribute to building an increasingly prosperous and fair community for everyone. In cooperativism, a virtuous circle operates where those who have invest in the cooperative and whoever needs it will take it as credit. That way, everyone wins. Furthermore, you will see the various actions we have developed over time, whether to offer financial products and services according to your needs or to provide sustainability. We hope that this year more people will have the opportunity to get to know Sicredi Biomas and be part of this business model that values ​​members and communities. WE COUNT ON YOU.

A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins came with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis , in Rio Grande do Sul. 6.5 million members30.8 billion net worth2nd institution with the highest release of rural credit8 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 20228 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022“Reaching the milestone of 120 years of credit cooperatives in Brazil fills us with pride, as it shows that we are consistently continuing the path that was opened by the German Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen around 150 years ago on the other side of the ocean and followed in Brazil by Father Amstad”. Fernando Dall’Agnese Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sicredi. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the early stages. decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining through time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promotion of quality of life.9 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM9Timeline Get to know some facts relevant histories of our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law no. 4,595/64, which imposed normative restrictions on the operation of credit cooperatives. 5,764/71 which defined the legal regime for cooperative societies. 1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.

Find out more about our story in the publication A Trajetória do Sicredi: https://www.sicredi.com.br/trajetoria/ 11 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM111 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a salary account on a mandatory basis for their employees, in a credit union membership happens differently. After the presentation on how Cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements , where traditional financial institutions see no possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members contract in the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as leadership election, remuneration or even even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:12 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 202212 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 20225 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their economic participation. of the members The members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of the operations generated by the money invested by the members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advance of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing quality food and essential items at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans gathered and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees or bosses, where the responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives for understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved.13 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM13Our cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM By playing our active role as associates, acting as business owners, we make life everyone's financial situation more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: 14 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 202214 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022 “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good” - Fr. Theodor Amstad As you can see, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Get to know our History inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. We want to be the main financial institution for our members. When they think about any type of financial product or service, remember the Cooperative. The more the member uses Sicredi Biomas, the more they earn and the more we can do for the communities with our campaigns and actions. It's a two-way street, so everyone wins. This is cooperativism.

At the beginning, the idea of ​​the cooperative was to encourage and support small rural producers in the region. In 1997, the Cooperative joined the Sicredi Credit System and was renamed Sicredi Noroeste MT. A few years later, in 2009, the name change of the Cooperative was approved to “Free Admission Credit Cooperative for Members of the Northwest of MT”. During an assembly held in 2015, members approved the beginning of the expansion of activities to the state of Acre. Five years later, there was also approval to take the Cooperative's products and services to the state of Amazonas, once again causing the name to change, which is now called Sicredi Biomas MT AC AM.

The Center Coordinators Meeting is one of the Cooperative’s most important actions, as it is here that the results of the previous year and the action plan for the year are presented to the legal representatives of the members. Coordinators have the fundamental role of fostering the cooperative essence among other members and helping to build a fairer and more prosperous society. It is at times like this that members truly play the role of business owners, participating directly in decisions about the direction of the Cooperative. This participation is essence of Sicredi Biomas' management model, in which the values ​​of democracy and transparency, central pillars of cooperativism, are put into practice.

And our associates make cooperation happen through democratic participation: we are together, we grow together. A cooperative is made up of participation. The presence of associates at events and decision-making is important for everyone's growth. Therefore, we provide all the necessary support to stimulate and increase engagement.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our incorporation we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social and governance) seeks to demonstrate that the long-term survival of organizations depends on them also generating value in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the market’s “ESG vision”, understanding it as its own management for business sustainability. Sicredi's three essential strategic guidelines, which guide everything we do: Mission, Vision and Values: describe the guidelines that guide our business and guide our development in practice. Based on our guidelines, we build the systemic documents and policies that guide our strategy, decision-making, operations and conduct. The Sustainability Policy establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact and reducing our adverse impact. To guide our sustainable development strategy, we established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.28 COOPERATIVA BIOMAS 2022We have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicredi's material themes, that is, the most relevant themes for the Sicredi’s sustainability.

The Reference is the basis for Sicredi's Positive Impact Measurement, providing indicators that allow us to measure our sustainability performance at national, regional and local levels. Monitoring these results can help us identify points where we have the opportunity to advance the Sustainability agenda.
