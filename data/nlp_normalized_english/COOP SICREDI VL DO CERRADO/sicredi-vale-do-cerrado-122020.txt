In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Vale do Cerrado - Sicredi Vale do Cerrado as of December 31, 2020, the performance of your operations and their cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information accompanying the demonstrations financial statements and the auditor's report The management of the Cooperative is responsible for this other information that comprises the management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management's report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management report and, in doing so, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the management report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. A member company of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 Company Responsibilities administration and governance through the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil, applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil and for the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless the management intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. You Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Security A high level of security is reasonable, but it is not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any relevant distortions that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to substantiate our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. • Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit to design audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on their effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management. 3 • We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the operational continuity capacity of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the fair presentation objective. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.
