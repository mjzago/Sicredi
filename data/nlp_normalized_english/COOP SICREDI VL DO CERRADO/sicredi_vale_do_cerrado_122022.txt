In In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended on that date. date, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and We comply with our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and does not we express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work done, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN), and by the controls that it has determined to be necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken into account together, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused due to fraud or error, we planned and performed audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We gained understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we must draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, March 10, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a increased inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of reducing the global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with Selic at 13.75% p.a. It is it should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If on the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in the October reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about fiscal policy which will be carried out in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous societyManagement Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. In 2022, Cooperativa Sicredi Vale do Cerrado continues its expansion plan with the opening of 4 new branches. One of them in the municipality of Planalto da Serra, completing 100% physical presence in all 12 municipalities in its area of ​​operation in the State of Mato Grosso, totaling a network of 16 branches. Additionally, the municipality of Jaciara was equipped with a new agency in Bairro Planalto, the Jaciara Planalto agency. In Amazonas, the expansion plan progressed towards the interior of the State, starting with the agency in the municipality of Parintins (known internationally for its culture and folklore), and the second agency in the municipality of Itacoatiara, ending the year with a presence of 04 agencies in the State of Amazonas, two of which are in the capital Manaus. Locally, the cooperative worked hard to ensure that the demands of its members were met, especially the needs for credit support and the maintenance of the communities' economic activity, reinforcing its commitment to its mission of adding income and contributing to the improvement of quality of life for associates and society. One of the actions was to hold another edition of the Solar Energy Fair, financing more than 500 solar plants and generating savings on energy costs for members. Furthermore, the vehicle fair once again made dreams come true with the financing of more than 530 vehicles. Finally, it promoted the Construction and Renovation fair, supporting the construction retail network and associates in carrying out their works. To sustain the growth of the credit portfolio, the largest campaign was promoted promotional campaign of all time with a draw for more than 240 prizes, the Poupar Prosperar e Ganhar campaign, started in January and ended on December 30th, distributing prizes to members who invested, saved and paid in capital in the cooperative during the year and took the cooperative to the best liquidity ratios in its portfolio. Sicredi Vale do Cerrado continues to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (automated teller machines, internet banking, application), which provided greater convenience for its members. One of the biggest deliveries is service through Whatsapp, with the expansion of the digital service cell, making it an alternative, safe and humanized channel and which in 2022 began to have the possibility of electronic signatures for contracting new products and transactions financial. In addition, new solutions are beginning to be offered to members, such as Taggy for passing to toll booths and parking lots and the Apple Pay digital wallet.To sustain the expansion, the year was also marked by the evolution of the cooperative's management and governance, aiming at the sustainability of the cooperative business: After being elected by members at meetings and approved by the Central Bank of Brazil, the inauguration of the new board of directors, with the renewal of 04 new advisors, 2 of whom are women and a young man seeking diversity in the cooperative's decision-making. Furthermore, the evolution of technical committees on the board of directors: Business, Compliance and Sustainability. The Cooperative also reinforced the structure of the business department by hiring more than 40 professionals at the cooperative's headquarters for management, advice and operational support of the agencies. It also expanded the service structure of its branches and headquarters with a staff of 378 employees, a 28% increase compared to 2021, supporting its growth. We ended the year with the graduation of <Transformative Leadership= program with the training of 49 leaders and trainees. Still on the governance front, we worked on improving communication with members and government officials and throughout the year we held meetings with Center Coordinators in the municipalities in our area of ​​operation. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and with the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 products and services financial services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlighted the following administrative facts: We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: In addition to its commitment to social business, the cooperative actively worked on socio-cultural and educational development actions through responsibility programs Sicredi social network. With the Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis program, we bring financial education to more than 16.5 thousand people, adults and children through meetings, lectures and training. With the Crescer Program, we bring knowledge about the principles and values ​​of cooperativism, impacting more than 1,200 members. Through the A União Faz a Vida Program, Sicredi's main social responsibility program, we actively participate in the lives of 370 educators and 7 thousand students from the education in the municipalities of Campo Verde, Dom Aquino and Juscimeira in the state of Mato Grosso. Through Cooperation Day, we mobilize our employees and associates to do environmental volunteering by planting trees in the municipalities where the cooperative operates. In 2022, APAE Campo Verde was awarded the implementation of the União Faz a Vida Program. Throughout the year we finance social actions and projects, developed by associations and philanthropic entities with transfers in sponsorships and donations through the Sicredi na Comunidade platform.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering the factor es and premises established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions They include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable realization or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision depending on the delay in the payment of the principal portion or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. Details of provisions and liabilities contingents is presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets assets may incur considerable judgments, especially when measuring potential associated future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of market and its financial instruments, the production of new operations credit and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. The liabilities contingents assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimatesq) Provision for civil, tax and labor risksDescription Total 2,279,824 2.666.351                                                            195.803                                             148.159  H 100,00                                            111.165                                     82.385                                                            111.157                                               82.36 9 G 70,00                                              39.137                                      20.219 27.396                                               14.15 3 F 50,00                                              26.042                                      23.946                                                              13.021                                               11.97 3 E 30,00                                              50.017                                      32.344                                                              15.005 9.7 03 D 10,00                                            107.867                                     81.842                                                              10.787                                                 8.1 84 C 3,00                                            215.335                                  225.750                                                                 6.460                                                 6.7 72 B 1,00 706.747 896.948 7.068 8.9 69 A 0.50 981.930 1.207.325 4.909 6.0 36 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 AA - 41.584 95,592 - - The amounts of securities and credits receivable were reclassified to the heading of amounts receivable relating to payment transactions to adapt the accounting of card payment transactions, in accordance with Circular Letter 3,828/17.
