In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Vale do Cerrado - Sicredi Vale do Cerrado as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and their cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits to financial intermediation revenue, due to the nature of the operations and (iii) the balances of non-operational results for the groups of other inflows and operating revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification . Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the development process of the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian standards and international auditing, always detects any relevant distortions that exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and we maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as Fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, March 25, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 The year 2021 was marked by the resumption. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperation alive. Through the credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to the improvement of the due quality of associates and society. Our traditional lines of credit continued to be active, as well as emergency government programs such as Pronampe (National Support Program for Microenterprises and Small Businesses) to assist in the development and strengthening of businesses. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand our options offering. adapted to the needs of each person in resuming and maintaining business. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to combating the pandemic and economic recovery. To expand sustainability and diversity actions, in 2021 the Sicredi System seeks resources outside Brazil through funding that makes it possible to promote credit to our members. In the first of these, we signed an agreement with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to stimulate solar energy projects, which allowed us to hold the 1st Solar Energy Fair with the financing of projects supporting the development of commerce and generating savings on energy expenses for members. In another international fundraising, we transferred resources destined to micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women, “Women Entrepreneurs” line. The initiative includes the gender factor as a criterion for acceptance of resources, as well as other social and environmental factors, generating new opportunities for the female public. We also transferred resources from Pronaf (National Program for Strengthening Family Agriculture), reaffirming our commitment to encouraging the countryside. FGTS workers and contributors were able to count on financing allocated in Anniversary Withdrawal Advance. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (automatic teller machines, internet banking, application), which made many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions. Seeking to improve the speed of digital service, we implemented our Virtual Agency in this exercise, making WhatsApp another alternative and humanized channel for our associates. In the second half of 2021 alone, there were more than 17 thousand services and 9.7 thousand associates served by the virtual agency's team of employees at the cooperative's headquarters. In parallel, we continue to operate in person in all branches, following health authorities protocols and maintaining these relationship channels with our associates. During this period of recovery, the cooperative promoted expansion and improvements in its branch network. We started the year 2021 by opening our agency in the municipality of Santo Antônio doLeste (MT). In July, We delivered the second agency in Manaus, the Amazonas Shopping agency, and also the reform of the agency in the municipality of Dom Aquino (MT), which has been operating as a cooperative for 30 years. And, to conclude the year's deliveries, the cooperative opened the Poxoréu branch (MT) in September, where the cooperative had a customer service office since 2020. With all this expansion, we ended the year with 16 branches and surpassed the mark of 300 employees. The year was also marked by structuring and improvements in our management and governance aiming at sustainability in our business: we promoted the constitution of the third board of directors of the cooperative (Business Board) and regional management in Mato Grosso and Amazonas; we expanded the work structure of our agencies and headquarters; we started the “Transformative Leadership” Program with the training of 49 trainee leaders; we implemented technical committees on the board of directors; we work on improving communication with the membership and government through the “Conexão Vale do Cerrado” and, during the year, we held meetings with Center Coordinators in all our municipalities. ADMINISTRATION REPORT In this document, the administration of the Sicredi Vale doCerrado cooperative, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the year ending on December 31 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Statements Financial. Board of Directors and Board On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: -We expanded the operations of the financial education program “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis”, impacting more than 11 thousand members through meetings, lectures and training; -With the Crescer Program we bring knowledge about the principles and values ​​of cooperatives to other lives of 4 thousand members. -Through the “AUnião FazaVida” program, we actively participate in the lives of 142 educators and 2,182 students from the education network in the municipalities of Campo Verde, Dom Aquino and Juscimeira, all in the state of Mato Grosso. In addition, we launched the book "Producing Senses, Experiencing Principles", which tells the story of the program's eight years in the municipality of Campo Verde (MT); -On Cooperation Day (C Day), we mobilized our employees and associates in the fight against hunger by collecting 71 tons of food destined for families in vulnerable situations; -Also throughout the year, the cooperative financed social actions and projects developed by associations and philanthropic entities with transfers in sponsorships and donations through the Sicredi na Comunidade platform. Sicredi Vale doCerrado ends its exercise surpassing the mark of 65 thousand associates, always attentive to their needs. This guaranteed us a dissatisfaction rate of 76.4% in our NPS (Net Promoter Score) dissatisfaction survey. The year was also marked by the Recognition of the GPTW (Great Place toWork) award, which makes us one of the best companies to work for, with a dissatisfaction rate of 90% among our employees. In this way, we continue to build and generate prosperity in the regions where we are present.

The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System were also observed. -COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33 and 46) and legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71 , with amendments by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as below: (a) Inflows from intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the inflows from intercooperative deposits were reclassified, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20 There was a change in the way in which statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. (w) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known cash amount and are subject to insignificant risk value, making it possible to classify it as cash and cash equivalent according to with the premises of CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the initial and final cash and cash equivalents of the period ending on December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of bonds and securities where they were previously presented. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules. Sicredi, on December 31, 2021, is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network of 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates 16 service points. The structure also has five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Sicredi Cooperatives (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”). The Cooperative is an integral part of the Credit Cooperative Guarantee Fund (FGCoop), a non-profit civil association, with legal personality of private law with national scope, as per Annex I to the resolution of the National Monetary Council ("CMN") No. 4,284, of November 5, 2013. OFGCoop's purpose is to provide credit guarantees in cases of intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250. per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity operations with these institutions. The Cooperative is also an integral part daSicredi Fundos Garantidores, a non-profit company whose creation of reserves comes from monthly and extraordinary contributions from cooperatives associated with the fund, which aims to ensure the credibility and solvency of its members. According to the rules established in the Guarantee Fund Regulations, monthly contributions are determined by the sum of two installments: fixed portion, related to the objective of each Fund; and variable portion, relating to the risk attributed to the System (considers levels of liquidity, capital margin and use of security devices).

Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00 from the CMN. The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 07; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by the Administration, constituting a provision for demands of a fiscal, civil, tax and labor nature through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the entity's probability of disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the existing uncertainty. Details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 17; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may incur in considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects arising from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the credit risk behavior of assets, market risks and their financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding . The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. The details of the impacts are presented in NOTE 32.q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by the Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, finalized in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient security. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. p) Taxes and contributions The Income Tax (IRPJ) and the Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative events. Provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ is 15%, plus an additional 10% and the CSLL in which the rate went from 15% to 20% as of July 2021 and will return to 15% as of January 2022, applied to the profit earned, after the adjustments to the calculation basis provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and tax basis calculation negative CSLL from previous years, with this deduction limited to 30% of taxable profit. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions for the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution for Social Security Financing (COFINS – 4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation, such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP ). In the municipal sphere, the cooperative is subject to the incidence of the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated based on revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. Income resulting from operations carried out with members does not incur taxes.

Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions for the purpose of financing operations. o) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) Are stated at known or estimated values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro-rata basis per day incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the highest of the net selling price and value in use of an asset. n) Deposits, loan obligations and transfers They are demonstrated by the amounts of the liabilities, considering the charges, exchange variations and monetary variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro-rata basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of amounts whose availability is immediate to associated partners, therefore without a deadline determined to move it, at the discretion of the resource holder do it as per your need. Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose.
