A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present.Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. 120 years offering financial solutions that make a difference in realizing dreams and projects120 years contributing to a more prosperous society120 years impacting millions of people throughout BrazilThere are For 120 years, Sicredi has been working to promote development for members and their regions, bringing hope to children through unity, all working towards the same goal. During this trajectory, Sicredi has not distanced itself from Father Theodor's dream and continues to maintain its essence. On a daily basis, being close to Sicredi, I can see the concern that the Institution has in complying with cooperative principles. In particular, I highlight the care and return to the community in that is inserted. Damares Zardetto de Lima Associate, Center Coordinator, Coordinator of the A União Faz a Vida Program and Deputy Coordinator of the Women's Committee Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands , learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis/RS, the priest joined 20 local associates, and, together, they put into practice this collective vision for building a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central, bringing together cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside, it arrived in the cities, maintaining, over time, the purpose of adding income through through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all associates, also promoting quality of life. 10 11 SICREDI PARANAPANEMA PR/SP 2022120 YEARS OF A GREAT HISTORY 10 111 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer salary accounts on a mandatory basis for their employees, in a credit cooperative, membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 5 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the Program School Cooperatives, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer Program and Cooperation in Ponta do Lápis, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together, in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members.7 Interest in the community The cooperatives of credit can be inserted in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in the assemblies. This way, everyone decides together the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as leadership election, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. 3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can be controlled only by its members, in a democratic management model.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advancement of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Compared to difficulties they faced in purchasing quality food and essential items at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans got together and founded the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each member contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, in which responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of cooperativism, as they understood that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM That were born with the Pioneers in Rochdale and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance), in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact: 1112 13 SICREDI PARANAPANEMA PR/SP 2022120 YEARS OF A GREAT HISTORY 12 13Our essence When we play our role active associates, acting as owners of the business, we make life everyone's financial situation more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit, to make their dreams come true, buy, produce and undertake. This way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes a VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF SICREDI Your money stays in your region! Sicredi Savings Maria saves her money at Sicredi. The cycle begins again With the local economy booming, Sicredi receives more investment from the population, and, thus, the cycle never stops. Results in the community As the resources are located in the region, the entire community is impacted, with a stronger economy, income generation and quality of life. Resources in the region Sicredi's resources are destined for the region where Maria lives. offering jobs, products and services, generating income and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the Cooperative and the use of financial solutions that they promote the business of members, the growth of the community and the development of people in the region. Advantages for members As they are members of Sicredi, Maria, Antônia and all local businesses have more competitive and healthy rates, in addition to the right to distribution of results in Sicredi. Residents use the resources Antônia, a rural producer, goes to Sicredi to look for resources to invest in your business, thus being able to produce more and boost local commerce. Through our solutions that go beyond finance, we expand the positive impact for associates and communities, also improving the living conditions where we operate. Thus, we can say that Sicredi configures a differentiated value generation model, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperatives in Brazil, sums up this view: “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good.” As can be seen, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of Sicredi.14 MAIN NUMBERS More than 120 thousand families impacted in our region R$ 33 million in results in our region + 40 thousand dreams and projects realized 02 Sicredi Nossa Paranapanema PR/SP 16 17 SICREDI PARANAPANEMA PR/SP 2022OUR SICREDI PARANAPANEMA PR/SP Nossa Sicredi Paranapanema PR/SP In the year 2022, Sicredi Paranapanema PR /SP continued to invest and believe in people and communities to meet the dreams of members and generate work and income in the region in which it operates.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our incorporation, we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social and governance, in the acronym in English) seeks to demonstrate that the long-term survival of organizations depends on them also generating value in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the market's “ESG vision”, understanding it as the management itself for the sustainability of the business.
