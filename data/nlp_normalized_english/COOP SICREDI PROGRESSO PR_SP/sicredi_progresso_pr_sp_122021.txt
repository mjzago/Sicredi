In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Progresso - Sicredi Progresso PR/SP as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the principles relevant ethical standards provided for in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprise the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or,2 otherwise, appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting practices adopted in Brazil to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its continuity operational and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may be due to fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.3  We assessed the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the going concern accounting basis operational and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible governance regarding, among other aspects, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, February 18, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 The year 2021 was marked by the resumption. Even with In the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through the credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines remained active, as well as program lines Public Power emergencies. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (automated teller machines, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow carrying out most operations without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we opened three branches, including two in Paraná and one in São Paulo, and we opened a Business Office in Toledo (PR). We are now in 12 municipalities with 20 branches, expanding our presence in both states. We already have more than 53 thousand members and 350 employees. Another administrative fact that deserves to be highlighted was the granting of commercial credit for the installation of solar energy. In 2021, we recorded an increase in demand for this modality compared to 2020. There was a growth of 40.34% in the volume released in 644 operations. On another front, The cooperative worked on numerous social business initiatives in 2021, contributing to the development of the community. Helping others, cooperating and making the world a better place are part of the Sicredi Progresso PR/SP culture. Demonstrating the strength of cooperation has perhaps never been more evident at a time when many people needed help due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During the months of June and July, the Cooperative joined the DiadeCooperar (Day C) movement, whose objective was to raise foods. The mobilization raised 28 tons, which were donated to 28 entities, chosen by the agencies. Cooperating is an act that happens every day and the DiaCse deliveries add to many other social responsibility actions carried out by Sicredi Progresso PR/SP. Examples are: adoption of lung ventilator masks for hospitals in western Paraná and remote actions to collect donations in support of the fight against Covid-19. The cooperative also embraced the idea that financial education It is one of the bases for generating a positive impact on society. Therefore, he participated in the 8th edition of the National Financial Education Week (ENEF Week). More than 100 employees wore the shirt to bring information to more than 2 thousand people. The activities were led by volunteers from the headquarters and 20 agencies in the states of Paraná and São Paulo. They visited schools and welcomed students to branches, where they gave free planning, budgeting and financial education workshops. adapted to the reality of each audience. The “União FazaVida” program is present in five municipalities in the region where it operates: Toledo, Nova Santa Rosa, Tupãssi, São Pedro do Iguaçu and Ouro Verde doOeste. Actions in 2021 impacted more than 3.3 thousand children and adolescents. More than 70 projects were carried out by early childhood education and elementary school teachers from the municipalities involved. The objective of these projects is to promote knowledge, experience and, above all, awaken students' curiosity. The Crescer Program training was carried out in all Sicredi Progresso branches. 420 members participated in the meetings, who were able to expand their knowledge about credit cooperatives and how they can participate more actively in the day-to-day activities of the cooperative.
