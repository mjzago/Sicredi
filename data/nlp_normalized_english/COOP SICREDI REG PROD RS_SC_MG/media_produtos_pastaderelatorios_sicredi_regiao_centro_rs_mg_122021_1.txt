In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Central Regions of RS and MG - Sicredi Região Centro RS/MG on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Re-presentation of the corresponding values ​​We call pay attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for financial intermediation revenue, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification . Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated . If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities board and governance of the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. At preparation of the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board intends liquidate the Cooperative or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for governance of the Cooperatives are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with the standards Brazilian and international auditing companies, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting distortion material resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We assess the suitability of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our works. Porto Alegre, March 3, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 The year 2021 was marked by the resumption. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through the credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment with our mission to aggregate income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We follow expanding the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we return to operating in person in all agencies, following the protocols of health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, the main administrative fact was the opening of new branches. We opened one in Belo Horizonte, near Lagoa da Pampulha, and another in Santa Maria (RS), our first agency segmented for agribusiness. Both do not have a treasury and cash service structure, which is why they are less transactional, becoming agencies dedicated to relationships, improving the consultative model of serving our members. The cooperative's headquarters in Santa Maria, the branch in Santana da Boa Vista (RS) and Restinga Seca (RS) gained new structures, with cozy, modern environments, improving Sicredi's way of serving. In relation to the renovation of the headquarters, it is worth highlighting the donation of part of the old furniture to the pediatric wing of the Hospital Universitário de Santa Maria (HUSM). Also noteworthy is the partnership with Sebrae RSnoProjeto Guiar, created to provide training and support to associates in the Central Region of Rio Grande do Sul; creation of a credit line to support individual microentrepreneurs (MEI); adherence to the systemic benefit of reduction in consortium product fees in the months of November and December, covering several members; the “CashBack” action of associate relationship baskets, making their maintenance exempt; in addition to expanding the scope of the business partnership project, seeking to speed up and facilitate delivery solutions for the needs of members. In addition, we granted Corporate Support Credit Lines for companies impacted by the Pandemic and made Pronampe and FGTS Withdrawal Advance Lines available. And, to expand sustainability and diversity actions, in 2021 we seek resources outside Brazil through decapitation. In the first of these, we signed an agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to stimulate solar energy projects. In another international capture, We seek resources for micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. The initiative includes gender as a criterion for using resources, as well as other social and environmental factors. The partnership agreement was signed with DEG, a German development financial institution, a subsidiary of the German Development Bank (KFW), and the French development agency Proparco, a subsidiary of the French Development Bank (AFD), development financial institutions (DFIs in the acronym in English) which have the objective of providing long-term financing and capital to private companies in emerging and developing countries. MANAGEMENT REPORT In this document, the administration of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Central Regions of RSeMG - Sicredi Centro Region RS/MG, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, discloses the Financial Statements relating to the year ended on December 31, 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of DirectorsOn another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: -Our DiadeCooperar (C-Day) was responsible for distributing 31.3 tons of food, which benefited more than 2.4 thousand families in vulnerable situations; -Through the “Cooperation at Ponta doLápis” program, we impacted around 6,956 thousand people throughout the year, distributed in 131 groups; -Our Crescer program brought more knowledge and information about cooperation to 4,912 thousand people, using face-to-face meetings (filled with care) and a reinvention of the digital model; -In digital format, we also continue to support our educators in the “AUnião FazaVida” program, which, in addition to consultancy services, held the first edition of Conexão in 2021 doSaber – a three-day training that brought names like educator Emília Cipriano to speak and interact with our teachers. We also held, together with two other cooperatives, a special live to celebrate Teachers' Day with the participation of the philosopher Leandro Karnal. In total, almost 1,100 teachers from 57 schools, distributed in 13 municipalities, benefited, multiplying the knowledge acquired with the more than 12,200 students present in this network; -Now the Cooperatives program Schoolchildren can, in addition to online training, hold a face-to-face meeting with teachers and representatives of the education departments of the five municipalities that receive the project, whose activities in 2021 impacted 257 students and 21 teachers from eight schools. -Our Social Fund invested resources in 36 initiatives from non-profit institutions, from Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais, supporting education, health, culture, sport, security and entrepreneurship projects. - From the Guide program, carried out in partnership with Sebrae, we support entrepreneurship, granting scholarships. Furthermore, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to tackling the pandemic and economic recovery. Among the actions, we highlight compliance with all measures and recommendations from the competent health bodies, which were essential for resuming in-person activities. Just as I use digital platforms, such as WhatsApp and the assistant virtual Theo, which made it possible to meet the demands of members safely. Sanitary measures also enabled the opening of new branches and the expansion of the cooperative, new physical spaces that will contribute to the local economy and also maintain relationships with members. 3,928 DEPOSITS (Note 12) 1,279,811 1,076,339 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2,300,446 1,869,421 Demand deposits 281,838 221,317 Interbank liquidity applications (Note 05) 152,698 28,517 Interbank deposits 61,527 12,022 Securities (Note 06) 399,804 480,387 Time deposits 936,446 843,000 Financial centralization (Note 04) 309,234 252,472 OTHERS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 540,004 385,811 Interbank relations 127 101 Interbank relations (Note 13) 502,540 336,788 Credit operations (Note 07) 1,362,037 1,054,784 Obligations loans (Note 14) 30,185 29,816 Other financial assets (Note 08) 76,546 53,160 Obligations for transfers (Note 15) 707 1,075 PROVISIONS FOR EXPECTED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT RISK (Note 07) (72,278) (75,067) Other financial liabilities (Note 16) 6,572 18,132 OTHER ASSETS (Note 09) 4,754 2,036 PROVISIONS FOR CIVIL, TAX AND LABOR RISKS (Note 17) 1,523 1,574 INVESTMENTS (Note 10) 39,432 34,618 Other liabilities (note 18) 103,547 73,017 immobilized use (note 11) 28,853 25,070 intangible (note 11) 5,824 6,471 equity (note 19) 386,972 329,736 SHARE CAPITAL 71,210 73,008 SURPLUS RESERVES 302,111 251,327 SURPLUS OR ACCUMULATED LOSSES 13,651 5,401 TOTAL ASSETS 2,311,857 1,866,477 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 2,311,857 1,866,477 The explanatory notes are an integral part of the Financial StatementsBALANCE SHEET (In thousands of Reais) Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Central Regions of RS and MG -

In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating income Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of surplus or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the natural balances in the groups of accounts of other income and operational revenues and other expenditures and operational expenses, for purposes prejudice the comparability of financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known cash amount and subject to an insignificant risk of value, being possible classification as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the initial and final cash and cash equivalent of the period ending December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of bonds and securities where they were previously presented. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules. Sicredi, on 31 December 2021, is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network of 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates 32 service points.
