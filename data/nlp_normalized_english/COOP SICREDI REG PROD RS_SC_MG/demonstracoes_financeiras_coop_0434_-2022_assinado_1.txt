In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Report of management and, in doing so, consider whether such report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be significantly distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to achieve assurance reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion.

As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the statements financial institutions, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.

Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of the cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and should continue to rise interest rates in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data has already point to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of the policy restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the price escalation. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. This document was digitally signed by Luiz Alberto Machado Lopes, Simone Nunes Bopp and Eduardo Netto Sarubbi.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realizable or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delay in payment of a principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss forecasts assessed by Management, constituting a provision for tax, civil, tax and labor claims through legal assessments. A Assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, in the minimum annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: A Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, market risks and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable successes are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment about the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 16%, in compliance with Provisional Measure No. 1,115, published on April 29, 2022, which increased the rate by one percentage point and producing effects during the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation base adjustments provided for in the legislation and the offset of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation base of previous years, with this deduction limited to 30% of taxable income. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Security Financing Social (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation, such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated from revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; the rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by current legislation in each municipality. Income arising from operations carried out with members is tax-free. q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) Are stated at known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to appropriate. p) Taxes and contributions This document was digitally signed by Luiz Alberto Machado Lopes, Simone Nunes Bopp and Eduardo Netto Sarubbi.

The market value of rural producer notes (CPR) is measured based on the interest curve, based on the rates negotiated in the B3 one-day DI futures market and the credit spreads obtained through the risk premium established for the counterparty of the operation. The operations of CPRs are carried out with members as long as they are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee. The joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system are considered to define a single spread for all counterparties. Fund shares are valued daily, through the value of the share, published by the fund administrator on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM and the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities - ANBIMA.

Given the future scenario with pessimistic data due to the consequences of activities affected by the Pandemic and internal studies of portfolio behavior and probabilities of losses, the Cooperative concluded that it has been having loss percentages above current levels and defined the change in risk levels A (from 0.5% to 0.7%), B (from 1% to 1.5%), C (from 3% to 4.5%) and D (from 10% to 12%). As provided for in Article 6 of CMN Resolution No. 4,846/20, the provision for losses for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must only apply to the portion of the credit whose credit risk is assumed by the Cooperative and these values ​​are being presented together with the amount provisioned for credit operations and other credits. The Cooperative also has co-obligations in guarantees provided in the amount of R$ 159,838 (December 2021 - R$ 120,422) which include operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to members via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor pursuant to a contract signed between the parties (Note 29). The provisions arising from these contracts comprise the amount of R$5,156 (December 2021 - R$ 3,716) as per Note 15. c) Composition of the credit portfolio segregated by sector of activity and maturity ranges Sector 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Due from 15 days Due 1,772,242 1,430,563 98,286 9,119 107,405 72,278 51,424 33,848 51,424 -                                     51.424                              33.848                       14.428                    9.571                             10.100                                         -                                     10.100                                6.700                       11.589                    6.146                               5.794                                         -                                       5.794 3.073                       27.913                  19.960                               8.374                                         -                                       8.374                                5.988                       61.888                  28.896                               6.189                                1.238                                       7.427                                3.468                     187.436                139.188 5.623                                2.811                                       8.434                                6.263                     757.053                596.525                               7.570                                3.785                                     11.355                                8.946                     642.674                570.957                               3.212                                1.285                                       4.497 3,992 Total 12/31/22 Total 12/31/21 17,837 25,472 - - - - b) Composition of the credit portfolio by risk levels Risk Levels% Minimum% Additional 12/31/22Portfolio Provision for expected losses associated with the risk of credit 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Minimum 12/31/22 Additional 12/31/22Os values ​​of securities and credits receivable were reclassified to the heading of amounts receivable relating to payment transactions to adapt the accounting of card payment transactions, in accordance with Circular Letter 3,828/17.

The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for managing the IRRBB risk of the Sicredi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the exposure to the IRRBB risk of the System's institutions.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provided for in item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the implementation plan for said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan.
