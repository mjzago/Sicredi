This is how we can summarize the year 2021 of our cooperative. In a context of reinventions and new perspectives on business, we completed our 40 years of struggles and achievements in cooperativism. During this trajectory, we seek to value our essence, which has been in our DNA since the beginning: the concern with offering a personalized relationship to our thousands of associates. At Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES, it is the member who directs the actions and steps of the cooperative. This is the desire of the Board of Directors, which encourages the search for ideas and impressions so that, together, the following year's activities can be designed. Therefore, everything we did in 2021 left essentially the needs of our associates – the 4 challenges of 2021 true business owners. During this period, we sought to fulfill these requests, enforcing the cooperative principle of democratic management. To our associates, in fact, a special thank you. We need to praise the appreciation and investment of each one of you in our cooperative, especially those who Ivo Miri Brugnera Presidente Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES nominated their family members, acquaintances and friends, contributing to the growth and strengthening of our business. Likewise, we thank the thousands of new partners who embarked on this journey of cooperation with the Alliance. Our 2021 was special and the numbers prove it. We had a 22.59% increase in our portfolio, ending the year with a total of more than 69 thousand members. Throughout the year, one of our work fronts focused on preserving the environment and improving the quality of community life. Therefore, we direct our efforts towards the lines of sustainable good practices, which focus on conscious and environmentally correct models such as solar energy, water and effluent treatment, replacement of conventional lighting with LED lights, among other practices that have a positive impact on business, in the environment and in people's lives. As we completed our four decades of history, we also had the honor of experiencing one of the most most important events in our history: the inauguration of our new administrative headquarters, in Marau, the birthplace of our cooperative. The space, spacious and modern, brings more convenience to members and the entire community, with features such as private parking and a large auditorium – with seating capacity for 447 people plus a special area for wheelchair users –, available for everyone to use. Because we are constantly growing, we reinforce our expansionist vision with the arrival in Espírito Holy. The expansion, which covered 19 municipalities on Espírito Santo soil, was unanimously approved at the Extraordinary General Assembly (AGE), held in March. In addition to expanding borders, we also changed the name of the cooperative, with the incorporation of the acronym ES. From now on, we envision a prosperous future, marked by the arrival of our cooperative in a new state, fulfilling our mission of bringing development to all regions where we are present. In 2022, we plan to implement our operations in Espírito Santo with the opening of the first branches. At the same time, we will continue the growth process in Santa Catarina, also with the implementation of new agencies in the state. Faced with such a challenging time as the one we are experiencing, imposed by the global Covid-19 pandemic, we are increasingly certain that the cooperative model stands out for its unity, showing its strength in the face of adversity. For us, this was a a period marked by learning, a year in which we added skills and competencies and reaffirmed our purpose of cooperation. It is exactly in this turbulent context that cooperativism reveals itself in its essence, as a vector of development and as a driving force, capable of overcoming difficulties and propelling the cooperative towards new horizons, in search of achievements. May 2022 be a year of even more cooperation. May we continue together, strong and united!

And we, at Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES, reaped good results during this period. One of these significant results concerns the cooperative's total assets.

At the same time, we made significant advances in the digital sphere, with investment in new technologies. As we strive to bring technology, innovation and digitalization, we seek not to lose the essence of physical contact, of concern for people. When seeking a balance between these two universes, we operate with a focus on the “physical”, which in other words means a fusion between the physical and digital worlds. While the physical model is present offering an experience to members, the digital model consolidates consumer relationships, facilitating access to various products and services. This is precisely what we believe in, complete and personalized service.

This is the thought which guides the work of Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES. For the cooperative, the big difference is not in the product, but in the service and relationships, which have been in its DNA since its foundation. Proof of this is the exponential growth in the membership portfolio, recorded especially in 2021. In April, the same month in which it announced its expansion to the state of Espírito Santo, the cooperative celebrated yet another achievement: the milestone of 60 thousand members. But the growth did not stop there.

In total, 231 volunteers participated in the campaign, which is carried out every year as a national initiative organized by the OCB System (Organization of Brazilian Cooperatives).36 Mostra Honorino Pereira Borges Mostra Pedagógica EMEI Tio Luiz Pedagogical Exhibition EMEI Sonho de CriançaPedagogical ExhibitionsSicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES understands that it is its role to promote the sustainable development of the regions where it operates. An example of this is the A União Faz a Vida Program, created 26 years ago by the Sicredi Foundation. The initiative aims to contribute to the integral education and protagonism of children and adolescents through a teaching methodology that encourages the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship. In 2021, the A União Faz Program Vida included 977 students and 107 teachers from two municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul. In total, there were seven schools served during the year, six of them in Marau (EMEI Favo de Mel, EMEI Criança Feliz, EMEF Hygino Coelho Portella, EMEI Tio Luiz, EMEF Honorino Pereira Borges and EMEI Sonho de Criança) and one in São Domingos do Sul (Frederico Benvegnú School). From April to December, 35 projects were worked on at PUFV, covering various topics such as the environment, health, healthy eating, the animal kingdom, among others. other matters, with the involvement of 154 employees. In addition to contributing to pedagogical and learning processes, PUFV establishes a culture where schools, students, teachers, families and communities assume themselves as protagonists of their educational and social trajectory, changing realities. In order to share the knowledge acquired throughout 2021 in the activities of the A União Faz a Vida Program, teachers and students from EMEI Favo de schools Mel, EMEI Criança Feliz, EMEF Hygino Coelho Portella, EMEI Tio Luiz, EMEF Honorino Pereira Borges and EMEI Sonho de Criança, from Marau, and Escola Frederico Benvegnú, from São Domingos do Sul, promoted, between the 6th and 9th of December , Pedagogical Exhibitions in its schools, covering various topics such as the environment, health, healthy eating, respect for diversity, dialogue, solidarity, among other subjects. Over the four days, a delegation from Sicredi Aliança, led by President Ivo Miri Brugnera, visited the schools to learn about and appreciate the work carried out by the students. “Education is one of the paths to transformation. And this is precisely the basis of the A União Faz a Vida Program: promoting knowledge, based on cooperation. The result is in the quality of the work and the commitment of everyone involved”, summarized Brugnera. 37 Local Development This stage of the program is called Qualification Initial and aims to promote knowledge of the methodology of the A União Faz a Vida Program, giving opportunities to educators to put learning into practice in the school environment and in the community. Another PUFV activity took place on August 6, at the administrative headquarters . It was a face-to-face meeting with teachers from the Municipal Early Childhood Education Schools Favo de Mel and Criança Feliz, in Marau (RS). The activity was led by pedagogical advisors Jandira Freitas and Nara Darlene, especially for the educators from these two schools, who joined the program in 2021. The moment was attended by the bee symbol of cooperativism and served to work on the PUFV methodology, covering the specificities of children from zero to five years of age and enabling teachers to develop these initiatives throughout the year in their educational institutions. The meeting also included the participation of the Municipal Secretary of Education of Marau, Simone Costenaro Ribeiro, from the municipality's Pedagogical Coordinator, Maikyeli Orsato Decesaro and the Early Childhood Education Coordinator Angélica Rigo Tibola, who welcomed the participants. Meeting with teachers from EMEIs Favo de Mel and Criança Feliz in Marau, took place at the administrative headquarters Meeting with teachers in Marau This stage of the program is called Initial Qualification and aims to promote knowledge and experience of the methodology and principles of Program A União Faz a Vida, providing educators with the opportunity to bring their work closer to project pedagogy and experimentation within the school and community. The stage also enables the reframing of educators' traditional pedagogical practices, the understanding of the curriculum as a set of experiences and the construction of interdisciplinary practices. In recent years, Sicredi Aliança has stood out in promoting credit for good sustainable practices. Among them is the financing of photovoltaic solar energy generation systems. In addition to the financial return, the investment in this segment meets the sustainability trend in the generation of clean energy. This is an indication that society is increasingly aware, focusing on sustainable initiatives, contributing to the consolidation of a more circular economy. According to data from the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), in 2021 Brazil registered a record number of new projects solar energy, increasing the country's installed solar capacity to 18 GW (in September 2020, projects under development reached 8.7 GW). Thanks to this growth, in 2021 Brazil joined the group of 15 leading countries in installed solar energy capacity in the world. In the cooperative's view, providing members with resources for the development of sustainable projects, such as solar energy, means thinking about the future, prioritizing positive impacts on the economy, relationships and the environment. Furthermore, it is an intelligent measure capable of generating value for the business and strengthening Sicredi Aliança's long-term partnership with the communities where it is present. This investment also brings several benefits, such as: strengthening local economies, with the creation of jobs; reduction of transmission and distribution losses in the electrical system, helping to reduce costs on consumers' electricity bills; generation of clean, renewable energy and sustainable for society; increased use of renewable energy; reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful substances; and the contribution to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The promotion of photovoltaic solar energy also contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to which Sicredi is committed as a member of the UN Global Compact . Check out some positive examples in the cooperative’s area of ​​activity.38 In addition to the financial return, investing in photovoltaic energy generation meets the sustainability trend, which indicates that society is increasingly aware, focusing on sustainable initiatives, contributing to the consolidation of a more circular economy. of photovoltaic solar energy One of these examples comes from the city of Camargo, in Rio Grande do Sul. The municipality is the headquarters of the company CEPAL - Cereais Pagnussat LTDA, part of the Pagnussat Group. With more For 70 years of existence, they serve agribusiness customers and suppliers, offering inputs and purchasing agricultural production. They also have a feed and mineral salts factory, serving the animal food chain on properties spread across the state and part of Brazil. In addition to the headquarters in Camargo, the group has three other branches in Casca, Marau and Soledade. In 2019, when searching for clean technology and, at the same time, reducing operational costs, CEPAL opted to invest in a solar energy plant and, to make this desire come true, it had a partnership with Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES, through the credit lines offered by the cooperative. After just over two years, Pagnussat states that the company is already seeing a return on its investments, at least to pay the monthly capital financed. "By believing in energy production 39 Local Development Industry in Rio Grande do Sul reaps the benefits of clean energyCEPAL opted for solar energy to reduce operating costs The plant has 2,200 photovoltaic panels and generates 742KWp cleanly, with natural resources, we are sure that we are already successful. The results will be reaped in the medium and long term, as the investment is high and the monthly return is partial. In this way, over the maturity of the installments, we will pay off the debt and, after completion, we hope to begin to have the financial return predicted by engineering in the construction of the project", he argues. In total, the The plant implemented by CEPAL has 2,200 photovoltaic panels and is capable of generating 742KWp, supplying 70% of the energy needed for the entire company. Satisfied with the investment, the businessman guarantees that the investment in photovoltaic energy generation was only possible thanks to the partnership signed between CEPAL and Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES. "Our relationship with the cooperative is long-standing, based on a lot of trust on both sides, which is capable of generating business and daily solutions for both parts", celebrates Roges Pagnussat."When we decided to install the plant, we went in search of resources so as not to affect our working capital. On this occasion, the Sicredi manager was receptive and helped us in the construction and implementation of the project, with financial support", explains Roges Pagnussat, owner partner of CEPAL. Another bet on photovoltaic energy generation comes from the city of São José, in Santa Catarina There, Espaço Jan Estética e Beleza, associated with Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES, invested in a solar plant with 22 photovoltaic panels. The investment in solar energy is part of some actions that the salon owner, Patricia Lohn, has been carrying out to use renewable resources in order to reduce the environmental impact and generate savings for the establishment. In operation since September 2021, the panels are already bringing a return to the business, with a minimum generation of 1200kW, representing savings of up to 80%. The owner explains that today, Adding the financing installment to the electricity bill, the bill is lower than before the system was installed. “People should take advantage of this to reduce the impact on nature and their wallets.” 40 Energy that comes from the sun also in Santa Catarina R$ 37,928,782.61 released 779 projects financedResults of the Cooperative's Investments in solar energySpace Jan invested in a solar plant with 22 photovoltaic panels “I am very satisfied with my investment. Sicredi financing made this possible, because today I pay less than I would on my electricity bill. I’m investing in something of my own that helps the environment”, highlighted Patricia. Espaço Jan is different, it works with beauty and well-being in an individual way and without standardization, completely unrelated to a stereotypical standard. Among the multiple services offered are hairdressers, manicures and pedicures, hair therapy, Kids Space, waxing, facial and body beauty and holistic therapies. In 2021, the space became the first Holistic Beauty in Greater Florianópolis and serves the whole family with unique environments. led the family to seek support from Sicredi Aliança and invest in purchasing the equipment. Now, the expectation is to grow even further. In the short term, they intend to expand the herd to 70 lactating animals, ensuring an increase in productivity and an increase in income. In addition to dairy farming, the family operates in the pig farming sector and also works with cultivation of grains such as corn, soybeans, wheat and canola. And this was not the first financing for the Borghetti Bido family with Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES. To improve production and the structure of the property, they have already had lines of credit to purchase other equipment such as tractors, trucks, warehouses and even investment in solar energy. In the view of the cooperative's executive director, Cristiano Piano, investing in agribusiness is a way of thinking about the future and valuing the local economy. “The strength of agribusiness has always been one of the pillars of Sicredi Aliança. We believe that investing in agricultural development and the use of new technologies directly contributes to better results, both in the countryside and in the city. It’s a two-way street, which brings benefits to all parties involved”, guarantees the manager. 41 Local Development Dairy production has always been the flagship of the agribusiness of the family of Moacir Bido, 41 years old, resident of location of Santo Antônio do Planalto, in the interior of Marau, in Rio Grande do Sul. In 2021, motivated by the interest in strengthening the business and reducing costs, the producer sought to invest in a robotic milking machine, also known as a milking robot. To make the purchase of the equipment viable, he had a partnership with Sicredi Aliança RS/SC/ES, of which he has been a member since 2005. It was through a line of credit offered by the cooperative that the family obtained financing, which today is responsible for doubling milk production on the property, representing an increase of more than R$200,000 per year in the family business's revenue. Alongside his wife Simone Borghetti Bido, 39, the producer maintains 54 lactating animals, spread over 19.54 owned hectares and a further 23.5 leased hectares. The activity is also carried out on another 35.45 hectares by Simone's parents, Carlos Borghetti, 68, and Anaclair Favero Borghetti, 67, who have been members of the cooperative for even longer: 27 years. Together and with the support of Sicredi Aliança, the family realized their dream of investing in properties and improving the herd's quality of life. “Today, these animals that we have in lactation have increased their production by 300 liters per day, thanks to the new milking system implemented”, celebrates Moacir Bido. More than increasing the number of daily milkings, the equipment also makes it more flexible and offers better time management, with a return on investment guaranteed. These were some of the reasons why Marau Producer invested in a robotic milking machine Moacir Bido sought to invest in a robotic milking machine Dairy production has always been the flagship of the family's agribusiness “Today, these animals that we have in lactation have increased production by 300 liters per day , thanks to the new milking system implemented”, celebrates Moacir Bido.Cooperativa distributes R$ 2.3 million in Capital Interest to membersProducers associated with Sicredi Aliança da Vila Maria agency Producers associated with Sicredi Aliança from the Marau Sul agency Build a more prosperous society, genuinely meeting the needs of its members. This is one of the purposes of the cooperative, which entered into a partnership with the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (Sebrae) to achieve this objective. This is the Rural Property Mapping Program which, together with specialists from Sebrae, sought to offer consultancy and mapping of rural properties to cooperative members. In total, 12 producers associated with Sicredi Aliança – six of them from the Vila Maria agency and another six from the Marau Sul agency – were invited to participate in the initiative, which had its first activities in August. Over the course of two months, members were assisted by a Sebrae consultant, responsible for sketching the areas, contributing to the planning and management of natural resources, in addition to serving as a step towards georeferencing, which in 2016 became mandatory for rural land measuring more than 100 hectares. Since then, new legislation has set a deadline of November 20, 2023 for properties between 25 and 100 hectares and November 20, 2025 for areas of less than 25 hectares. Therefore, the service offered by the cooperative takes a step forward in meeting a legal requirement. By having legalized property, producers avoid penalties and are able to the Rural Property Registration Certificate (CCIR), a document necessary for procedures involving rural property land. The program ended in October, when producers visited the administrative headquarters of Sicredi Aliança and participated in an evaluation meeting, followed by a lunch. The more than 69 thousand members of the cooperative ended 2021 with extra income . This is because Aliança made the deposit into the capital account, on the day December 22, of the income on its share capital. Partnership offers mapping of properties 42 The amount distributed reached R$ 2.3 million and also represented an investment in the economy of the 11 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul and 17 municipalities in Santa Catarina that make up the area of ​​operation of the cooperative.fraternization. "The mapping was very important, because there are three people on my property: me, my wife and my daughter. From now on, whenever we need it, the information they will be there, on paper. It's a guarantee for the future", summarized producer Jairo Basso, one of the beneficiaries of the partnership between Sicredi Aliança and Sebrae. Over the course of two months, members were assisted by a Sebrae consultant, responsible for sketching out the areas , contributing to the planning and management of natural resourcesThe closure occurred after the arrival of Santa Claus, who delivered the gifts It's good to do good. Packed by this spirit of cooperation and solidarity, the cooperative promoted, on the afternoon of December 8th, the first edition of Solidarity Christmas, which benefited 75 children and teenagers served by Associação Beneficente São Francisco de Assis (Abesfa), in Marau (RS). The program, developed at the cooperative's administrative headquarters, began with the screening of a Christmas film in the auditorium. Afterwards, everyone could have fun in the recreation space with inflatable toys in the foyer, as well as distribution of snacks like cotton candy, popcorn and hot dogs. The closure took place after the arrival of Santa Claus, who delivered gifts (school kits) to the children. Currently, Abesfa – an entity appointed by the City of Marau to participate in the action – serves Natal Solidário, benefiting 75 children and teenagers in Marau 43 Local Development The program, developed at the administrative headquarters of the cooperative, began with the screening of a Christmas film, at auditorium.
