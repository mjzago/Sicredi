In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Univales - Sicredi Univales MT/RO as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the principles relevant ethical standards provided for in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements carried out on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for financial intermediation revenue, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other inflows and revenues operational and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification . Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the development process of the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian standards and international auditing, always detects any relevant distortions that exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and we maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as Fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, February 25, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9MANAGEMENT REPORT In this document, the administration of the Univales Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative - Sicredi Univales MT/RO, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, discloses the Financial Statements relating to the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the auditors' report independent on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to the improving the quality of life of associates and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic media service (ATMs, internet banking, app), enabling many of our demands since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we are back to operating face-to-face in all branches, following the protocols health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we carried out high-impact automations and flow changes for good business performance in 2021, making processes more agile and improving the experience in relationships with associates and employees. Among the actions the following stand out: 1–Automation of rental discounts and negotiation of advance date rates in our acquiring operation which, in turn, brought greater clarity and also greater volume of receivables schedule for Sicredi accounts; 2–Offer of the Partner Platform for financing Construction and Renovation, Solar Energy and Vehicles directly at retailers, with the same rates practiced in the branch network, decentralizing credit and offering greater convenience to our members and greater support to associated and partner companies (with receipt of credit on T+1, free of additional fees); 3–Realization of the Mega Feirão de Veículos and doCircuito deEnergia Solar, which took place simultaneously in September and October, using the partner platform, exhibitions at agencies, media dissemination and data capture. We went from 90 vehicles financed, on average, to 500 dreams come true in two months, in addition to over 100 photovoltaic energy projects financed in a single month, reinforcing our commitment to renewable, sustainable and clean energy; 4–Decentralization of updating registrations and rural credit (costing), which made the journey – from prospecting to hiring – much simpler, with credits and registrations being requested directly from Rural Credit Agents (ACRs). The measure reduced the average time for deliberating proposals from 40 days to 15 days and updating records from up to 15 days to a maximum of four hours. We also reviewed the credit criteria. All these actions generated an average growth of 70% in the credit portfolio with the agricultural public (between January and November), rising from R$ 736 million to R$1.2 billion; 6–Training focused on protecting our associates’ assets in order to offer a more complete service. Consequently, the cooperative achieved a growth in its Insurance portfolio of 46.50% in relation to the previous year, rising from R$27.5 million to R$40.3 million; On another front, the cooperative operated in numerous social businesses, contributing to the development of the community. In 2021, the Cooperative maintained its main Education program as a priority Cooperative to listen to members and people and disseminate Cooperativism. There were more than 5,995 participants in the Crescer Program, with actions carried out in a hybrid format. In relation to Financial Education, the Cooperative expanded its initiatives, training more than 8,096 people, whether through the comic books of Turma da Mônica, with the program “Cooperation at Ponta doLápis in Schools”, or the training of young people and adults from the most varied professions and segments, dealing with of personal finance from the perspective of consumption behavior and the relationship between the topic and family prosperity. The year was also marked by the expansion of the “AUnião Faz a Vida” program, which expanded from four to eight municipalities. Despite social isolation, we recorded more than 600 hours of training, using remote and in-person meeting formats, impacting 5,603 people, including students and teachers. Using the Social Fund, the Cooperative supported 36 projects led by the community that make a difference in the lives of people, permeating cooperation, education and local development initiatives. And, in line with youth leadership and women in governance, we celebrated the entry of 148 new core coordinators to work in the next cycle, 26% of which are young associates and 30% are female associates. They will be the spokespersons for 74 thousand members, acting as true ambassadors of cooperativism in the community. #ASSETS 2,185,230 1,426,018 LIABILITIES 1,792,306 1,088,544 AVAILABILITY (Note 04) 17,709 12,071 DEPOSITS (Note 12) 1,059,897 692,170 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2,134,752 1,398,269 Demand deposits 454,412 385,323 Interbank liquidity applications (Note 05) 17,161 9. 840 Interbank deposits 132,930 36,051 Securities (Note 06) 238,890 251,961 Term deposits 472,555 270,796 Financial centralization (Note 04) 170,395 160,910 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 588,321 308,537 Interbank relations 635 1,309 Interbank relations (Note 13) 573,710 294,666 Credit operations (Note 07) 1,603,547 912,382 Loan obligations (Note 14) 8,831 8,723 Other financial assets (Note 08) 104,124 61,867 Other financial liabilities (Note 15) 5,780 5,148 PROVISIONS FOR EXPECTED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT RISK (Note 07) (52,256) (44,233) PROVISIONS FOR CIVIL, TAX AND LABOR RISKS (Note 16) 639 1,664 OTHER ASSETS (Note 09) 6,788 6,345 OTHER LIABILITIES (Note 17) 143,449 86,173 INVESTMENTS (Note 10) 42,097 27,673 ASSETS IN USE (Note 11) 30,281 19,503 EQUITY QUIDO (Note 18) 392,924 337,474 INTANGIBLE (Note 11) 5,859 6,390 SHARE CAPITAL 118,469 115,825 SURPLUS RESERVES 237,369 200,688 SURPLUS OR ACCUMULATED LOSSES 37,086 20,961 TOTAL ASSETS 2,185,230 1,426,018 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 2,185,230 1,426 .018 The notes explanatory statements are an integral part of the Financial StatementsBALANCE SHEET (In thousands of Reais) Univales Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative -
