In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international standards audit. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 Conjunto A - Block A 1st floor - room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF - Brazil Tel: +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.brIn connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for controls that it has determined to be necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute audit procedures in response to such risks, as well as obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We have obtained an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit so we can plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. Still, Future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasília, February 27, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8* The commercial agenda for the year 2022 was carried out with the support of the communication and marketing area on several fronts, such as Sicredi's official WhatsApp, SMS and email capture leads through social media promotion, seeking audiences that would not be easily reached through traditional media. * Regarding credit, several actions were carried out with pre-approved lots throughout the year, which enabled greater efficiency in the conversion of opportunities and less compromise to the liquidity of our Institution. * An exclusive offer was launched for Urban Individuals with card exemptions and cashback upon use of the card. The same offer was carried out in the acquisition of credit cards for the Corporate public. These changes allowed us to gain more than 15,000 new members in 2022, representing the largest percentage increase in the last three years (20%). * Several actions were carried out to attract investments from the market, which generated an increase of approximately R$250 million in term deposits, injected directly into our liquidity. * In relation to gaining efficiency and experience, we are starting to centralization and automation of business activities, to gain scale of growth and provide a better experience for our associates. * Actions aimed at increasing commercial productivity and revenue diversification were maintained. * New branches opened in Rondônia (expansion area of ​​our cooperative) and opening of our business office in Porto Velho, marking the arrival of Sicredi in the State Capital. We are a committed cooperative financial institution with the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and growth sustainable. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve conditions life of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and must continue at this high level until half of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed for income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: * The Cooperative maintained its main Cooperative Education program as a priority, to listen to members and people, and disseminate Cooperativism. There were more than 5,400 participants of the Crescer Program, in face-to-face and digital format. Regarding Financial Education, the Cooperative expanded its initiatives, training more than 9,790 people, whether through Turma da Mônica Comics, with the Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis in Schools, or in the training of young people and adults, of the most varied professions and segments, dealing with the topic of personal finance from the perspective of behavior and consumption habits and their relationship with the prosperity dreamed of by families. We start also a Financial Education Day in Schools, where we trained more than 90 teachers to include them as an extra-curricular subject for more than 1,600 students from 12 schools. * Expansion of the A União Faz a Vida Program. The Program went from 7 to 13 municipalities and we coordinated the adhesion of 3 more municipalities to work with the partnership in 2023, with the accession of 2 of the 3 articulations, expanding this network of commitment to an inclusive, civic and cooperative and transformative for 15 cities in the Cooperative's area of ​​operation in Mato Grosso and Rondônia. The impact reached 13,148 people, including students and teachers. * With the Social Fund, 30 projects were supported by the Cooperative, led by the community, which make a difference in people's lives, permeating cooperation, education and local development initiatives. * In line with youth leadership and women in governance, we celebrated the entry of 139 new core coordinators for action in the next cycle, and of them 22.3% are young members and 28% are women members, representing the voices of our more than 90 thousand members, aiming to improve the Cooperative's performance, being the true spokespersons and ambassadors of cooperativism in the community. Recognitions For over 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies for Work, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best institution financial services in Brazil in physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include the provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in payment of a portion of principal or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss forecasts assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may incur considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, market risks and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of captures. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Pronouncements Committee Accounting (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as losses possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and such as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main judgments and accounting estimatesAlso at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation, such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated from revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; the rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by legislation in force in each municipality.

The Sicredi System's market risk management processes include: • Clear rules for classifying the trading portfolio that guarantee the correct treatment of operations; • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to market risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's market risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of methodologies for market risk to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the dimension of exposure to market risk of the System's institutions. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the adopted business continuity strategies are defined. They are provided for in the Policy of Integrated Risk Management and Sicredi's Business Continuity Standard, the basic principles and the necessary structure to guarantee the adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the entities' most critical processes. The Business Continuity Management system structured in Sicredi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and disaster recovery strategies from you; • Operational and IT continuity plans. Finally, Sicredi makes available to all its agencies a template for the continuity of activities of the agencies, which allows the creation of a customized document, in order to meet the main scenarios of interruption of activities=. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in the market values ​​of positions held by an institution financial. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices. The market risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing market risk. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: • Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by legal minimum capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risk appetite, aiming maintain capital to support risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors; II - Operational Risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties resulting from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out in a joint venture between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated throughout the institution; • Identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation of operational risks; •Identification, collection and treatment of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Dissemination of the risk management culture throughout the organization; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to assess, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Risk of Business Continuity Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue the delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to the recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved.                             

Director CPF: 486.705.610-34I) Implementation Plan for the accounting regulations established by CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021 On November 25, 2021, CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 was published, which provides for the concepts and criteria accounting rules applicable to financial instruments, as well as for the designation and recognition of protection relationships (hedge accounting) by financial institutions and other institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil, converging with the main concepts of the international standard IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments arising from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard, there is the need to prepare a Implementation. Said plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the plan for implementation of said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan.
