Able to track and analyze the financial history of any individual, helping to identify and defend the cooperative from bad payers. It also has the ability to ensure business sustainability and support society by providing secure credit.PowersCredit risk is the possibility of financial losses associated with non-compliance with an obligation under agreed terms. In other words, it is the risk of lending an amount and not receiving it back. So how do we protect ourselves? At Sicredi, there is a Credit Risk area that supports our centers and cooperatives in analyzing credit granting. In practice, they help identify the risks that may arise from a concession decision and guide us on how we can protect ourselves in situations of high risk of loss. The area also provides reports on the health of the cooperatives' credit portfolio, calculates the risk classification of members and monitors credit concentrations that may imply greater risks. As a result of working together with different areas, we have a portfolio of associates that grows exponentially with one of the lowest default rates on the market. Imagine that a person asks you to borrow a certain amount. Would you help her without thinking twice or would you prefer to analyze whether she will be able to give back in the future? Just as there is a risk of loss when we lend money to someone, it is no different with financial institutions. A power to be proud of: granting credit sustainably When we work together, we protect our institution from credit risk and, with this, we benefit our associates who are also owners of the business.

Main risks What you can do • Granting poorly evaluated credit, granting amounts with a high risk rating and, consequently, a high risk of financial loss; • Lack of qualitative assessment for provisioning, not reflecting the real risk of loss of the credit operation; • To concentrate granting credit to a few members or to a group of people who share credit risk. • Be careful when evaluating and granting credit, prioritizing the granting of credit to members classified with the best risk range; • Distribute the granting of credit across different groups of members, credit products and economic sectors; • Pay attention to systemic risk appetite and risk indicators; • Carry out the appropriate risk markings when identified situations that could lead members to not make credit payments. Provisioning is the main reserve instrument for expected losses; • If in doubt, contact the credit risk areas (CAS level) or the employees responsible for the credit cycle of the cooperative/credit granting (Cooperative level).
