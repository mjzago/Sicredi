All Sicredi Sul SC movements in 2022 had this objective through our local actions. But even with the local focus, it is important to analyze the global situation in which we operate. Furthermore, we grew 30% in members and 41% in resources raised compared to 2021. Globally, 2022 was a year that presented an economic scenario of increased inflation due to the war between Russia and Ukraine. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle that began in 2021 began to produce data that point to a tendency towards disinﬂation. Acting in this context, in 2022 we reached the mark of R$1 billion in credit operations, which include support for the contracting of equipment to generate renewable energy and incentives for ventures by members of the Women Entrepreneurs Line.
