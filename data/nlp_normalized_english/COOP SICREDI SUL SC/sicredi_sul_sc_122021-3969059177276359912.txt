If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for statements financial The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of statements financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit performed, In accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, it always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements.

In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention to it in our report audit of the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation.

Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through the credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment with our mission to aggregate income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We follow expanding the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), which made many of our demands viable as these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we return to operating in person in all agencies, following the protocols of health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this year of recovery, the main administrative fact was the continuation of our expansion project, with the opening of three new branches: Orleans, Siderópolis and Cocal do Sul. With this progress, we reached the mark of 19 agencies, distributed in 13 municipalities in the south of Santa Catarina. On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: -Crescer Cooperative Education Program: we carry out distance training. In the virtual course, we highlight the principles and business model of cooperativism. In 2021, 124 members and 12 non-members were trained; -Program “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis”: we promote in-person and virtual awareness raising actions on financial education for young people, children and adults. In 2021, 725 people were served by the program; -Social Fund: part of the results of the cooperative were allocated to support initiatives in the areas of education, culture, sport, environment, safety and health. In 2021, 80 projects were supported. - “AUnião FazaVida” Program: consists of its own methodology, based on the school curriculum, developed through cooperative educational projects in which students are protagonists of the learning process. In 2021, the program served 460 Early Childhood Education and Elementary Education students at the Paulo Pedro Petruzzelis school, located in Criciúma (SC); - “People who cooperate, donate” program: focusing on the 7th principle of cooperation, "Interest in the Community", we created this program to encourage blood donation among employees and associates. In 2021, we motivated 54 candidates, with 49 donations made; -Cooperate Day: from 2021 onwards, DiaC actions, celebrated on July 3rd, started to be carried out throughout the year. Common organized calendar, the agencies mobilized to carry out initiatives in favor of the community that involved collecting food, cleaning materials, hygiene products, toys, geriatric diapers, food, among other items. The donations benefited several entities in the region; -Online consultancy in partnership with Sebrae: the initiative served members classified as micro or small companies.

The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives were also observed, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows from intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows from intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization do not They are characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the more appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the natural balances into the groups of accounts of other income and operational revenues and others expenditures and operating expenses, for the purpose of favoring the comparability of financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known cash amount and subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03. This correction affected the initial and final cash and cash equivalent of the period ending December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of bonds and securities where they were previously presented. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and the Sicredi’s internal rules. As of December 31, 2021, Sicredi is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network of 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates in 19 service points. The structure also has five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Sicredi Cooperatives (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”). The Cooperative is part member of the Credit Cooperativism Guarantee Fund (FGCoop), a non-profit civil association, with national private law legal personality, as per Annex I to the resolution of the National Monetary Council ("CMN") No. 4,284, of November 5, 2013. OFGCoop's purpose is provide credit guarantees in cases of intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting credit operations assistance, financial support and liquidity with these institutions. The Cooperative is also an integral part of Sicredi Fundos Garantidores, a non-profit company whose creation of reserves comes from monthly and extraordinary contributions from cooperatives associated with the fund whose purpose is to ensure the credibility and solvency of its members. According to the rules established in the Guarantee Fund Regulations, monthly contributions are calculated by the sum of two installments: fixed portion, related to the objective of each Fund; and variable portion, relating to the risk attributed to the System (considers levels of liquidity, capital margin and use of security devices).
