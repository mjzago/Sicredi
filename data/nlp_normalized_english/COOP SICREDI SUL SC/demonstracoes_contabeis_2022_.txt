Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following facts administrative: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a posture of monetary tightening, starting the high global interest cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its cycle of rising interest rates in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25 % - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, The monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a deinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest cycle with Selica 13.75% p.a. and should continue at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, as credit increases and prices rise. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society #Classification of information: Internal Use• Creation of the Cooperative Development Incentive Fund, whose main objective is to support financial amount of R$ 1.00 per CPF or CPNJ to pay the initial capital quota for individuals and legal entities that meet the requirements for membership in the cooperative; • We reached 37,753 members, a growth of 30% compared to the same period in 2021.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the plan for implementation of said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (analysis of Gaps); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan. Capital Margin consists of the institution's capital surplus to the requirements regulatory minimums and additional principal capital. NOTE 32 – INSURANCE CONTRACTED As of December 31, 2022, the insurance contracted is considered sufficient by management to cover possible losses related to the guarantee of values ​​and assets owned by the Cooperative. The risk assumptions adopted, given their nature, are not part of the scope of a financial statement audit and are consequently not examined by our independent auditors.
