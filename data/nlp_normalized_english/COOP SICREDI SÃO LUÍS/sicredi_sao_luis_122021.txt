If, as a result of the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for preparing and adequately presenting the financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, related matters with its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing statements financial Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. The distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:  We identify and evaluate the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.3  We conclude on the appropriateness of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, March 16, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9REPORT OF ADMINISTRATION In this document, the administration of the Credit Cooperative of Doctors and Health Professionals of São Luís - Sicredi São Luís, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, discloses the Financial Statements relating to the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of DirectorsThe year 2021 was marked for resumption. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines remained active, as well as the lines of the Public Power’s emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of electronic service solutions (automated teller machines, internet banking, app), making many of our demands viable since, These are complete channels that allow most operations to be carried out without having to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we seek resources outside the country aimed at micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. The international fundraising initiative includes the gender factor as a criterion for the use of resources, as well as other social and environmental factors. The partnership agreement was signed with DEG, a German financial development institution, a subsidiary of the German Development Bank (KFW), and the French development agency Proparco, a subsidiary of the Bank of French Development (AFD), development financial institutions (DFIs) that aim to provide long-term financing and capital to private companies in emerging and developing countries. On another front, the cooperative promoted numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Traditionally, Sicredi actively participates in Cooperate Day (C-Day), celebrated on July 3rd. In 2021, the action was aimed at food collection and our cooperatives collected almost 750 tons. Donations directly benefited more than 100,000 people experiencing food insecurity. Furthermore, we continued to operate the movements “Gente que Coopera Cuida” and “Eu Coopero com a Economia Local”, which helped us take care of people and communities, reaffirming the strength of cooperativism as an engine capable of contributing to the continuity of activity. economy in the country. Among the main businesses of the year, we also highlight the actions carried out in conjunction with the Financial Education program. Conducted individually within the cooperative itself, they benefited many members.
