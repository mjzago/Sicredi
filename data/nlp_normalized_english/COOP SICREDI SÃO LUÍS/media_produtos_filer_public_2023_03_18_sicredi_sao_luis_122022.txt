Credit Union of Doctors and Health Professionals of São Luís - Sicredi São Luís Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Confederation SicrediAccounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendency of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 Independent auditor's report on the financial statements To the Administrators, Advisors and Cooperatives of the Credit Cooperative of Doctors and Health Professionals of São Luís - Sicredi São Luís São Luís - MA Opinion We examine the demonstrations financial statements of the São Luís Doctors and Health Professionals Credit Cooperative - Sicredi São Luís (“Cooperative”) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in net equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BAC EN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with the other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Rel management office, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BAC EN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless be that the The board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken into account together, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused due to fraud or error, we planned and performed audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We gained an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, with based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts in relation to the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are fundamental included in the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, March 16, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 We value people and diversity Our Commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: Financial education programs carried out in the cooperative itself individually with members and we participated in the C-Day action. Traditionally, Sicredi actively participates in Cooperate Day (C-Day), celebrated on July 2nd. In 2022 the dadata motto is “simple attitudes, move the world”; participating organizations carried out social responsibility actions in the communities, aligned with the principles of cooperation, through volunteer initiatives. Furthermore, we continue to operate the movements “Gente que Coopera Cuida” and “I Coopera com a Economia Local”, which helped us to take care of people and communities, reaffirming the strength of cooperation as an engine capable of contributing to the continuity of economic activity in the country. .We are a cooperative financial institution committed to growth of our associates and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our founding. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperation, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with the fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50% , and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets in the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching a record decline and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% at reading In October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous societyRecognitionsFor more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized rankings and national awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Revista Exame, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work for, from Revista Você S/A, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil for physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.

These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations These are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to the Administration's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and specific risks in relation to operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is recorded in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in clearing accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. c) Interbank liquidity applications Represent operations at fixed prices referring to purchases of securities with commitment to resell and applications in interbank deposits and are stated at the redemption value, net of the corresponding income to be appropriated to future periods. d) Securities The portfolio is made up of fixed income, variable income and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to their respective fair values, as applicable. Income and expenditure, as well as income and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the accrual regime, which establishes that income and expenditures and revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of results for the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when if they correlate, regardless of receipt or payment, allocated proportionally according to the amounts of gross income from a cooperative act and gross revenue from a non-cooperative act, when not identified with each activity. Operations with fixed rates are recorded at the redemption value, and the income and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities. Income and expenses of a financial nature are accounted for using the pro-rata die criterion and calculated based on the exponential model, except those relating to discounted securities or related to foreign operations, which are calculated based on the linear method. Operations with post-fixed rates or indexed to foreign currencies are updated up to the balance sheet date. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ 154 (2021 - R$ 105) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts. B) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are represented by cash available in national currency, foreign currency and interbank liquidity applications, the values ​​of which are applied by Cooperatives in Centrals via Financial Centralization and by shares of fixed income and multimarket investment funds, with short-term maturity, for example, three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to draw up an implementation plan. Said plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the year 2022. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the implementation plan for said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan. Capital Margin consists of the institution's excess capital over the minimum regulatory requirements and the additional principal capital.
