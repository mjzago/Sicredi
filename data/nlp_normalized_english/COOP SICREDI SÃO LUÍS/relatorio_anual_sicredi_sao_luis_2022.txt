Year after year, it has not been easy to manage ﬁnancially in this whirlwind of news. We went through controlled inflation and low interest rates, soon after the post-covid recovery came a period of high consumption with soaring prices due to lack of raw materials and also due to economic activity as a whole stopped, logically, interest rates soared in an attempt to contain this inflation! The financial sector, led by the Central Bank, had to do all this reading and prepare with short movements to make the economy turn around quickly in the face of the challenges they presented at that time. It is true that Brazil came out ahead in this fight, we have been living with these uncertainties for some time and we have already fought hard against the “dragon” of inflation because we have wisdom on this topic unlike Europe, North America and Asia. In times like these, default and provision are inseparable friends: reducing results and making us very careful when evaluating credit. Yes, this is everyone's business and it must be very well taken care of, respecting and following all the risk criteria created by the Central Bank's regulations. Credit cooperatives continue to grow in our country, I firmly believe that it is an excellent model economical, has credibility and is very participative, different from traditional banks. The year 2023 will also be one of great challenges, we are evaluating situations and solutions to make our cooperative bigger and much stronger, rest assured that we are working hard to achieve new achievements. A big hug to everyone.120 YEARS OF SICREDI ________________________________05 Timeline__________________________________07120 years of Cooperativism120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM 5120 years of Sicr ediCooper activism: from associates. +6.5 million affiliated credit unions. +100 agencies spread across the country. +2.4 thousand SICREDI SÃO LUÍS 2022In 2022, Sicredi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. It was opened by the German Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen around 150 years ago on the other side of the ocean and followed in Brazil by Father Amstad. Fernando Dall’Agnese President of the Board of Directors of Sicredi (SicrediPar)a, Theod or Amstad was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They began a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model emerged in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside to cities, maintaining over time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promoting quality of life. taken ahead, it overcame the challenges 120 YEARS OF COOP ERATIVIS MO 7Timeline Discover some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law no. 5,764/71 that the legal regime of companies cooperatives.1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.
