The Brazilian and global economies still suffered several impacts resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, with heterodox reﬂections on economic agents, including Financial Institution. Despite the difficulties faced, the Cooperative fulfilled its mission of providing financial assistance to its members under special market conditions. We expanded service points, aiming to ensure our presence in the Cooperative's area of ​​operation, opening three new branches in the cities of Goiana, Paulista and Vitória de Santo Antão, also fulfilling the plans in the Work Plan presented at the last Assembly. In that context, the Selic rate went from 2% to 9.25% p.a., increasing the cooperative's and resource borrowers' fundraising costs; inflation reached 10.25% p.a., affecting operational costs; the Gross Domestic Product of 4.25% was flat compared to initial perspectives; while the unemployment rate reached 13%, with the appreciation of the dollar, which reached R$5.70. Finally, we would like to thank our associates for their trust and the commitment and dedication of our employees, advisors and managers who contribute daily for the success of the Cooperative.
