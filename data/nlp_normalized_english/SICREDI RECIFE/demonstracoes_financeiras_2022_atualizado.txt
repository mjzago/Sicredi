Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate.

In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperatives, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fedfunds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% -4.50%, and should continue to rise interest rates in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until half of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the other hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society #Classification of information: Internal Use Sustainability Committee On October 18, 2022, the Sicredi Recife Sustainability Committee completed a year of activities.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering established factors and assumptions based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Items Significant factors subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constitution of a provision due to the delay in payment of the principal installment or charges for the operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in the CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the note Operations Credit; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. Details of provisions and liabilities contingent is presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may incur considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects arising from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the credit risk behavior of assets, market risks and their financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts arising from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, finalized in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; • Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those that cannot be measured with sufficient certainty and such as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates The Income Tax (IRPJ) and the Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ (15%, plus an additional of 10%) and the CSLL is 16%, in compliance with Provisional Measure No. 1,115, published on April 29, 2022, which increased the rate by one percentage point and producing effects during the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the offset of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation basis from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of the taxable profit. Still within the scope federal, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation, such as the surpluses determined in the Statements of Surpluses or Losses (DSP). At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the incidence of the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), determined based on gives income from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. Income arising from operations carried out with members is tax-free. q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to the resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central edemais institutions with the purpose of financing operations. o) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) These are stated at known or estimated values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro-rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributionsAre demonstrated by the amounts of liabilities, considering charges, monetary exchange variations up to the date of financial statements, recognized on a pro rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability is immediate to members, therefore without a fixed period for moving them, leaving the resource holder's discretion to do so according to their needs. Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also to specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose. Term deposits are made up of amounts agreed for availability within pre-established deadlines, which are updated by remunerative financial charges according to their post-fixed contract and are demonstrated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. Interbank deposits are made up of resources received in deposits from other institutions in the market, in accordance with current regulations specific to interbank deposit operations, observing that the institution must maintain internal controls for the purpose of funding limits. #Classification of information: Internal UseDescription 9,196 NOTE 07 – CREDIT OPERATIONSValue of cooperative shares 1,158 1,158 1 1 9,196 173,677 Net income for the year 115,902 (15,246) 1,195 33,761 (2,660) 1,807 Shareholders' equity 3,298,737 2,111,744 369,267 368,071 176,667 5.54% Share capital 3,208,211 2,108,211 161 161 165,967 165,967 Percentage of participation 0.04% 0.05% 0.62% 0.62% 5.54% 9,196,095 804,049 PN 804,049 PN Quotas Quotas Quotas Number of shares /shares owned353 .336 ON 353.336 ON 1 1 9,196,095 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Sicredi Participações S.A.

For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: Processes and policies for managing market risk They are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's market risk management processes include: • Clear rules for classifying the trading portfolio that guarantee the correct treatment of operations; • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to market risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's market risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of market risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the exposure to market risk of the System's institutions. V - Risk of Variation in Interest Rates on Instruments Classified in the Banking Portfolio (IRRBB) OIRRBB is the risk, current or prospective, of the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the results or economic value of the institution, resulting from instruments classified in the bank portfolio. The processes for managing IRRBB risk in the Sicredi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to IRRBB risk appetite of the Institution in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the IRRBB risk exposure of the System's institutions. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, continuity strategies are defined of business adopted. The Basic Principles and Structure necessary to ensure adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the entities' most critical processes are set out in Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard. The Business Continuity Management system structured in Sicredi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and IT disaster recovery strategies; • Operational and IT continuity plans. Finally, Sicredi makes available to all its agencies a manual model of continuity of agency activities, which allows the preparation of a customized document, in order to meet the main scenarios of interruption of activities”. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in market values. held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices.

The centralized structure is responsible for establishment of processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing market risk. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including uncovered risks by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risky appetite, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors; II - Operational Risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for third-party damages arising from activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Singular eCooperative Centers. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the entire institution; • Identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation of operational risks; •Identification, collection and treatment of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Dissemination of the risk management culture throughout the organization; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue delivering products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents.
