Belonging Fully aligned with the principle of democratic management, the Pertencer Program encourages the active participation of members. The peak moment is the nucleus assemblies, when the associates assume the protagonism and participate in decisions that affect the direction of the business. In them, the main themes are debated and deliberated, representatives are elected, accountability is approved and the distribution of results is decided, among other issues.
