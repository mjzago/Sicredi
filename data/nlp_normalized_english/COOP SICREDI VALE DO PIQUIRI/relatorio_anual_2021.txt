There are more than 5.5 million associates, who jointly decide the direction of the business. We are a network that supports prosperity through responsible financial solutions and with a true interest in human beings. In 2021, we celebrate 33 years of history. What began with the union of 35 rural producers who were looking for a new financial alternative, currently have almost 200 thousand members, who are at our side to build an increasingly solid and sustainable cooperative. If before our activities were carried out only under a staircase, in a space provided within C. Vale, in Palotina (PR), today we are present in large financial addresses and can take cooperativism to more and more people. Throughout our trajectory, we do not leave aside the humanized essence, which allows us to pay attention -Here money yields a better world Cooperative differences12 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SP Purpose To build a more prosperous society together. Values ​​Unrestricted preservation of the cooperative nature of the business; Respect for the individuality of the member; Valuing and developing people; Preservation of the institution as a system; Respect for official and internal standards; Efficiency and transparency in management.Causes As a cooperative financial institution, we practice the maxim of transforming our world through the strength of the collective. der, understand and delight associates through close and personalized service. We have strong roots in the principles and values ​​of cooperativism. Being sustainable is one of them. We strictly follow Sicredi's Sustainability Policy, which establishes guidelines to guide decisions in all areas of the business, in order to increase the positive impact and reduce the adverse one. Furthermore, our guidelines are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations (UN), which reinforces adherence to the Global Compact. Our sustainability strategy is guided by three drivers: relationships and cooperation, responsible solutions and local development, with the pillars: economic, social and environmental. biental. This contributes to the development of people and the communities where we operate, in a fair and prosperous way, as we believe that conscious choices can make the world a better place to live. 13 Principles of cooperativism Free and voluntary membership; Democratic management; Economic participation; Autonomy and independence; Education, training and information; Intercooperation; Interest in the community. Inspiration To be an institution protagonist in local and sustainable development. Vision To be recognized by society as a cooperative financial institution committed to the economic and social development of members and communities, with sustainable growth of cooperatives integrated into a solid and effective system. Missions Offer financial solutions to aggregate income, contribute to improving the quality of people's lives and value the relationship.Investment14 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SPThese actions meet the SDGs: Investment15 Financial education is an essential tool for the sustainable development of associates and the communities where we are present. Through it, we encourage conscious attitudes in money management and encourage entrepreneurship. When people make planned decisions, they prosper financially. This is one of the reasons that prove that investing in a cooperative is different. By investing in the cooperative, members help in the economic and social development of communities, as the resources raised remain in the areas where the cooperatives operate and increase the contracting of rural and commercial credit. This generates a positive local impact and encourages a virtuous cycle, as cooperatives gain greater capacity to support the development of the regions where they operate, benefiting members and the local economy. sustainable manner. All this with the tradition of an institution that has 119 years of experience and solidity proven by ratings: three international credit risk rating agencies assigned grades according to our payment capacity. The ratings are: Brasil AA by Fitch Ratings, Brasil Aa1 and Global Ba2 by Moody’s, Brasil AAA and Global BB- by Standard & Poor’s. Social capital is one of the drivers of the virtuous cycle If capital means money or invested assets - and social refers to society, social capital constitutes what is invested in a society. Thus, when a person joins the cooperative, they deposit a sum of money that we call a share, which is each member's share. Therefore, everyone owns the institution. In banks, the owners are just the shareholders and they are the ones who receive the dividends. In the cooperative, as everyone is an associate who participates and decides together, nothing is fairer than the result will also be distributed according to the operations and movements of each person throughout each year. Encouraging financial education Financial health is important for us to also have quality of life. With conscious associates, their financial decisions are planned, which leads to sustainable development for their businesses and communities. Therefore, we encourage prosperous attitudes in money management and local entrepreneurship. Especially In this period of adversity and uncertainty that the world is experiencing, I encourage -AInvesting in a more prosperous society16 INVESTMENT ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SPwe need a financial reserve, which was one of the great differences for small investors.

In addition to contributing for the financial health of members, the resources remain in the cooperative, which helps to finance the numerous sustainable lines of credit that we provide. ESG equity investment fund At the end of 2021, Sicredi announced a new option for investors interested in applications aligned with sustainability practices.

With the launch of the fund, we continue in the direction of offering a greater possibility of diversification in investments for members, as well as bringing alternatives that generate greater positive impact. At Sicredi, we believe that investment should yield more than money.

For those who are not yet an investor in the cooperative, I recommend it. ” Antônio Passos, an associate at the Mooca agency, in São Paulo (SP), was one of the winners in the draws for the Razões promotion to Invest and Earn “The excitement is great. I just have to thank Sicredi and the agency's employees, as they were the ones who offered me the investment that resulted in this award. I have never received an award of great value like this, other than my health, children and my family. I always tell others that, as we are part of a cooperative, together we have more strength and invest safely. ” Alcides Beltramim, associate of Francisco Alves (PR), was the recipient of the final draw of R$500,000 from the Reasons to Invest and Win promotion “Sicredi came to help us.

Therefore, our way of granting credit prioritizes proximity to members so that we understand their real needs and offer the best solutions for each one, expanding access to lines of credit with fair rates. To further increase our positive impact, through the offering of products and services, we support the prosperity of our associates, in addition to collaborating with sustainable development communities and society as a whole. We offer a wide portfolio of solutions that improve members' lives and businesses. We were born in the countryside and support agribusiness at all stages of its production chain, providing products and services with socio-environmental attributes for rural producers. Our good performance in the credit lines provided by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) to minimize the impacts of the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic was valued by the “Incentives for Financial Agents” project. We were recognized in two categories, with first place in both: BN - DES Pequenas Empresas – Development Banks/Cooperatives and Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) – Development Banks/Cooperatives. We believe that, for economic growth, credit is essential to generate employment and income. As we have a genuine interest in the places where we are included, our role in sustainable development becomes extremely relevant. Green economy Sicredi Vale do Piquiri Abcd PR/SP supports sustainable development by offering financial solutions. Therefore, we seek to identify opportunities for creating and improving products with an eye on sustainability. We have several lines of credit aligned with the green economy, which significantly reduce environmental risks and ecological scarcity. Financing for solar energy is one such example. To facilitate access and encourage members to adopt this system, the cooperative made R$118.8 million in funding available, ending the year with a portfolio of R$178.4 million. Credit cooperatives generate financial inclusion Credit cooperatives play an important role in providing access to complete financial services for municipalities considered to be less attractive to the maintenance of bank branches. This is what the third study in the series “Benefits of Credit Cooperativism”, organized by Sicredi, showed. The work evaluated the performance of private, federal and regional public banks, and cooperative financial institutions Conscious and humanized creditCREDIT 22 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SP22 between 2010 and 2018, generating indices that show the level of difficulty for physical performance of institutions in each municipality and how they behave in this scenario. Based on the observation that Brazilian municipalities have different social, economic and territorial characteristics, and, therefore, have various levels of attractiveness for the physical insertion of a financial institution with a complete portfolio of solutions, the study sought to quantify and make the effort required to operate in the localities comparable. To achieve this, the team of economists at Sicredi developed the Banking Presence Index (IPB), which reflects the probability of not having a branch in a given city, and the Municipal Banking Indices (IMB), relative and absolute, which can, based on the IPB, demonstrate the level participation of institutions in municipalities that are difficult to operate, as well as showing the aggregate contribution of presence. + R$178 million in credit for solar energy 3,944 operations, which represents 0.32% of power nominal value of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant US$ 120 million raised with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to stimulate solar energy projects with the IFC the objectives are being met 23 23 89 million people The results brought evidence that, compared to the others, the The cooperative service network is in places where banking is more difficult, that is, in regions that are more complex for the banking network to operate. Thus, it was reaffirmed the capacity of credit cooperatives as a differentiated means to bring complete financial services to the population, given the still great need for Brazilians to become bankable, even with all the advances provided by technology.

A practical example of this importance occurs in Paraná. Soybeans and corn are strong crops in the region, and the products are commonly sold to other locations, even to the outside. Using the example of the cooperative, in the financing of a thousand poultry farms and given that the chickens eat corn and soy, we concluded that, if these commodities were sold fresh, they would generate R$ 1.2 billion. The sale of chicken meat corresponds to the movement of R$ 3.2 billion, which remains in the region. In addition to the gain in added value, the chain generates almost 14 thousand jobs. These are people who go to the market and stores in the region, making money cular locally.Point your cell phone camera and access the research on financial inclusion “I own a car dealership and we chose to finance photovoltaic energy at Sicredi because of the ease in contracting the credit line and the relationship with the agency's managers.

If we could summarize In a word, our mission, this verb would be chosen. We want to take care of people and their assets so they can prosper. Human beings are at the center of everything we do and, if we want to provide the best experience for members, this perspective has to come, first and foremost, from within the cooperative and its staff. In 2021, still in the midst of a pandemic year, we further strengthened our listening process to understand the needs of each and ensure a positive work experience for everyone. Internally, we offer the Semper Bem channel, aimed at providing psychological assistance to employees, anonymously. Throughout the year, we organized a series of lives, which talked about topics such as mental health, men's and women's health, as well as meetings on commemorative dates, such as Father's and Mother's Day, to bring us closer further. The Summer Convention was one of them. Held in February with the theme: “Cooperativeism moves us. Differentiation defines us”, the live event brought together employees for moments of exchanging knowledge and relaxation, and showed how each person can make a difference in the lives of people and communities. At the Winter Convention, in August, the motto was: “People who cooperate, care”. The event aimed to help rediscover the joy that lives within each being.

Then, based on a diagnosis that combines strengths and growth points, employees create their individual development plan. All of this in a manner that contributes to achieving current and future strategic objectives in a sustainable manner. Over the years, we have also expanded our cultural base, which appreciates each employee as a unique being, as we understand and reinforce - We believe that differences must be valued and respected.

Through actions that contributed to reducing damage to physical and emotional health, the cooperative took care of finding out more about each person's well-being every day, in a loving way that gave us a sense of security. ” Edirlene Duarte Rodrigues, business manager of Ubiratã (PR) Gender Male 40.1% Female 59.9%49 Digital50 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SPThese actions meet the SDGs: 51 We innovate with courage to generate a positive impact. One of Sicredi's axes concerns transformation, which seeks to enhance digital and cultural changes within the institution. This offers employees the opportunity to learn quickly and develop themselves. We always try to have a different perspective on the market financial. With digital transformation, this occurs in a broader and simpler way, without losing our essence and the Sicredi way of being. The digital transformation process we are going through aims to further improve procedures, so that they become more agile and less bureaucratic, which reduces possible rework and repetitions. Every day, we evolve to improve the experience of employees and, mainly, associates. The transformation it provides what we call a physical experience, which is nothing more than the union of the physical with the digital, a revolution that offers members more autonomy in self-service, whether in branches or online. Strengthening the financial lives of members, with an intelligent, simple and secure digital experience, and providing collaborative economic evolution are elements that are part of the essence of cooperativism. For the future, even more news is coming.NUm look to the futureDIGITAL Transform processes Paperless Automated back office Employee experienceFisital experience Data drivenCooperative nature User at the center Omnichannel strategy DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION 52 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SP52 Woop: free and uncomplicated digital account Combining wow (wow ) and coop, Woop is Sicredi's digital account and promotes the development of regions, as each Wooper is part of a cooperative. Participation promotes the development of communities and allows the results to be shared among everyone at the end of the year. In addition, they can also vote on the cooperative's decisions. Woopers have at their disposal a current account, savings account, financial manager, transfer between accounts, sending and receiving TED, payment of bills and consumption bills, withdrawals, debit and credit cards (international and without annual fees), all of this with service via in-app chat, email, phone or with Eliza, Woop's artificial intelligence. Currently, we have more than 11 thousand accounts open in the cooperative, numbers that continue to grow. Digital banks have free accounts, but none of them offer what we do best: being cooperative. WhatsApp Enterprise As a bet on digital transformation to bring cooperation to more and more people, we deliver a series of new technologies and so - solutions so that associates have even more autonomy and agility in their daily lives, without, of course, leaving aside the human service that is already our trademark. One of these tools is WhatsApp Enterprise. To access it, the member simply sends a message to the number (51) 3358-4770, the same for Sicredi throughout Brazil. The system identifies the data and directs it to a specialized team at the cooperative, which provides all assistance individually, not mechanics. This solution adds – a lot – to the routine of members, with a simple interface and several resources. In the cooperative, we reached more than 18 thousand services through the solution. Theo: the super connected He already arrived with a big name. Theo, the virtual assistant on WhatsApp Enterprise, was named in honor of Father Theodor Amstad, founder of Sicredi and icon of credit cooperation in Brazil. The chatbot was created with the aim of optimizing the service to members, as it can resolve doubts and provide services through the use of artificial intelligence, such as: services related to credit cards (issuing invoices, tracking queries, limits, expiration dates, best day for purchases and even blocking due to loss or theft), taking out insurance, location of branches, among others. Thus, many of the needs are resolved only with virtual service, without the member needing to go to the agency, with convenience and total data security. Theo is available 24 hours a day to assist on WhatsApp Enterprise. Theo shows that it is possible, yes, to combine the ease of digital with the proximity that exists in physical contact, as with it communication remains close, even in the virtual world.

As they are digital, this number means a reduction of approximately 16 sheets of paper per open account. PF Platform The PF Platform came to simplify the processes of opening accounts and purchasing products. All cooperative agencies are already using the platform and we surpassed the mark of 9.5 thousand accounts opened, with an average time of 12 minutes to open the account and contract products and services. This results in printing savings of more than 57 thousand bond sheets. New Cash A new way of making movements and transactions. This solution was built in a more intuitive, safe and technological way, which made work in agencies easier, as, in just a few clicks, it is possible to carry out tasks that were previously difficult. considered more time consuming. This way, the employee works in a more objective and simple way. Digital signature The digital signature came to replace the physical signature on documents, which saves time, without using paper. In the cooperative, this process began in July 2021 and, currently, all agencies are able to use the subscription portal. We have more than 32 thousand documents sent for digital signature, which represents more than 192 thousand sheets that were no longer used in printing. Valley of Innovation We believe that leveraging the ecos - system in a collaborative and innovative way is what makes a difference in people's lives. Whether through solutions linked to the digital transformation process, or improving processes, we believe that this is only possible when DIGITAL Benefits of digital signature Improvement in the member experienceOperational reduction in branches Possibility of service to members who cannot go to the branch Reduction in waiting time for the release of products and services Simplification and improvement of processes Support for sustainability (environment) Financial savings - reduced costs with printing, sending and archiving documents Security and legal validity 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SP people are at the center of everything that is done. The culture of innovation must encourage the protagonism of everyone, which is essential for the project to be sustainable in the long term. To further strengthen this experience, the cooperative launched an innovation program with the aim of working and further developing the creative potential of its employees. The first engagement actions have already been put into practice: a large movement involved employees to suggest and choose a name for the program, which then came to be called Innovation Valley. After, everyone was involved in creating the logo. For 2022, activities continue. Innovation Index We believe that transforming is not just improving what exists. Transforming is rebuilding and giving new meaning, without losing our essence. This purpose was felt in the research applied by the international institute GPTW (Great Place to Work), which measured the IVR (Innovation Velocity Ratio). The score of 7.15 represents that, more and more, employees are opposing - innovation units in the cooperative. Current account Savings of 57,042 sheets Savings Savings of 19,431 sheets Also savings on scanning, rework, product procurement, printer ink, document storage, among others. Savings through the digital model “I would like to report the help and ease I had with the service from Theo, Sicredi's virtual assistant. The service was carried out very quickly, met all my needs and clarified my concerns. doubts. I loved learning about the assistance we have available at the cooperative. ” Tainara Medeiros, associate from Iporã (PR) “It is easier to sign contracts with a digital signature. This way I don't need to go to the agency to resolve these more bureaucratic things and I make better use of my time in my daily life. ” André Luiz Biessek, associate at the Santana agency, in São Paulo (SP) 55 As a cooperative financial institution, it is part of our mission to promote a better future and sustainable for associates and in the locations where we operate. For us, sustainability is business management with a focus on expanding our positive economic, social and environmental effect, reducing adverse impacts and generating value for everyone. Our operating model, with management excellence, based on honesty and transparency, directly reflects on our financial results. This essence makes us more prosperous and solid every year. In 2021, we reached 96 branches (54 in Paraná and 42 in São Paulo) We expanded our base of account holders by 11% compared to 2020 Funding totaled 24% growth compared to 2020 Credit surpassed the R$ 4.6 billion mark and indicated a growth of 40% compared to the previous year Assets totaled more than R$ 5.6 billion, which, added to co-obligations, meant that the total volume of assets + co-obligations exceeded R$ 6.4 billion All of this made us achieve the result history of R$ 118 millionExpansion in numbers56 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 - SICREDI VALE DO PIQUIRI ABCD PR/SPASSOCIADOS ACCOUNT HOLDERS AGENCIES PARANÁ 2020 2021 EVOL.
