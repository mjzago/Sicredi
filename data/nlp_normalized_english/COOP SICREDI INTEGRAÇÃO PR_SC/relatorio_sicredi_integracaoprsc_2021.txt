Sicredi Experience Time is a key factor in all of our lives, especially when we go to an agency. Having a positive experience at the agency is a very important factor in promoting the institution, a point that leads people to use the products and services more and to recommend Sicr edi to other people. Thinking about these issues, Sicredi Integração PR/SC created the Sicredi Experience concept and space, a place where members and non-members can be served quickly, resolving specific issues, obtaining information and access to channels and acquiring pr oducts, without losing the human contour of Sicr edi. Service in the space – which has qualified and experienced employees – unifies the main services and demands of members, reducing waiting times. For specific issues and negotiations, our team of managers remains available to members. The agencies that already have the Sicr edi Experience space are: Contenda, São Mateus do Sul, Quitandinha, Lapa, Araucária, Paranaguá and C ampo Largo. Sicr edi Experience Space, more agility in service to members. 15 Annual Report 2021 Sicredi Integração PR/SC
