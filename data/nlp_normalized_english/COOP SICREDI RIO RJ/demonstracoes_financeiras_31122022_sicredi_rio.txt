Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of Rio de Janeiro - Sicredi Rio RJ CNPJ/MF nº 72.128.440/0001-30This Bulletin is an integral part of the Sicredi-Rio Annual Report Diagramming: Ctrl S Comunicação Rio de Janeiro / RJ, March 29 2023Sicredi rio balance sheet 2022Sicredi rio balance sheet 20222 MANAGEMENT REPORT Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase of interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advance of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of the restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machine and 100% digital account, serving individuals, companies and rural producers.

Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting.

NOTE 32 – OTHER INFORMATION I) Implementation Plan for the accounting regulations established by CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021 On November 25, 2021, CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 was published, which provides for the accounting concepts and criteria applicable to instruments financial institutions, as well as for the designation and recognition of protection relationships (hedge accounting) by financial institutions and other institutions authorized to operate by the Bank Central do Brasil, converging with the main concepts of the international standard IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments.

Sincerely, Benjamin Waissmann AdvisorCélio Abdalla AdvisorAntonio Carlos De Castro Freitas AdvisorInternational auditing companies, we exercise professional judgment and we maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our - your opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. • We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the estimates accounting records and respective disclosures made by the board. • We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the ability to continue operating -national of the Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain operational. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the statements financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation.
