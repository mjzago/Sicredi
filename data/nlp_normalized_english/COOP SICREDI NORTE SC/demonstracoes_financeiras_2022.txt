Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve people's living conditions who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided adopting a monetary tightening stance, starting the high global interest cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its cycle of rising interest rates in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4. 25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a deinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest cycle with Selica 13.75% per year and should continue at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, as credit increases and prices rise. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We opened four new agencies in the State of Para: Ag.UnimedPrime; Capanema. It is worth highlighting that we have signed strategic partnerships, such as participation in the agreement with the Federation of Commercial and Business Associations of Pará - FACIAPA, together with the cooperatives Sicredi Sudoeste MT/AP, Sicredi Grandes rios and Sicredi Integração MT/PA/AP, appearing as the entity's official Cooperative Financial Institution.

These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified in accordance with the Administration's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in clearing accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. ancestry and are demonstrated by the redemption value, net of income to appropriate corresponding to future periods. d) Securities The portfolio is made up of fixed income securities, variable income securities and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to the respective market values, as applicable. Inflows and expenditures, as well as revenues and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the accrual regime, which establishes that inflows and expenditures funds and revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of the results of the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated, regardless of receipt or payment, allocated proportionally according to the amounts of gross income from a cooperative act and gross revenue from a non-cooperative act, when not identified with each activity. The result is determined according to the accrual basis, which establishes that revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of results of the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated, regardless of receipt or payment. Operations with fixed rates are recorded at redemption value, and income and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities. Income and expenses of a financial nature are accounted for on a pro-rata die basis and calculated based on the exponential model, except those relating to discounted securities or relating to foreign operations, which are calculated based on the straight-line method. Operations with floating rates or indexed to foreign currencies are updated up to the balance sheet date. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ (603) (2021 - R$ (352)) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts. b) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are represented by cash and cash equivalents in national currency, foreign currency and interbank liquidity applications, whose values ​​are applied by the Cooperatives in the Centrals via Financial Centralization and by the shares of fixed income and multimarket investment funds, with short-term maturity, for example, three months or less, from the date of acquisition and which are subject to insignificant risk of change in value.

When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the higher between the net sales price and the value in use of an asset.j) Investments These are stated at acquisition cost, refer to participation in companies in the Sicredi System, adjusted by provision for losses when applicable. k) Fixed assets for use Corresponds to rights that have as their object tangible assets intended for the maintenance of activities or exercised for this purpose.

Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be free movement, leaving it at the discretion of the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose. Term deposits are made up of amounts agreed for availability within pre-established terms, which receive updates through remunerative financial charges according to their contracting in post- fixed and are stated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. Interbank deposits are made up of resources received as deposits from other market institutions, in accordance with current regulations specific to interbank deposit operations, noting that the institution must maintain internal controls for the purpose of funding limits. Availability 2,127 833 The financial statements are expressed in reais (R$), which is the Cooperative's functional currency, unless otherwise indicated, in thousands of reais (R$ thousand). t) Recurring and non-recurring results Recurring results are those that are related to the characteristic activities of the Cooperative that occur frequently in the present and expected to occur in the future, while non-recurring results are those that arise from an extraordinary and/or unpredictable event, with a tendency not to be repeated in the future. NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed each semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustments of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constitution of provision due to delay in payment of installment of principal or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697 /00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss forecasts assessed by Management, constituting a provision for demands of a fiscal, civil, tax and labor nature through legal assessments. The assessment of loss forecasts takes into account the entity's probability of disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the existing uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the loss test due to reduction to the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered depreciation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may incur considerable judgments, mainly in the measurement of potential associated future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects arising from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: The Administration monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, market risks and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts arising from covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currency 3 to 12 months Over 12 months Total Total Cash and liquidity financial investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of presenting the cash flow statement, when complying with the provisions of CPC 03 (R2) – Statement of cash flows.
