72.5 Sicredi Financial Statements 2022/1 Sicredi Centro Pernambucana Credit Cooperative Executive Board of Administration Controllership Superintendence Management Report In this document, the administration of the Sicredi Centro Pernambucana Credit Cooperative, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management 53 in accordance with the provisions legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the semester ended June 30, 2022. Sicredi, as a cooperative financial institution, is committed to the growth of its members and the development of the regions where it operates. We remain firm in our commitment to contributing to the economic activity of communities, considering their different realities and needs, constantly seeking to create opportunities for connection between members and the newest technological trends, stimulating income generation and local economic and social development, with the purpose of having a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable society every day. The close relationship is essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, even more so in a period of economic recovery, offering financial solutions for micro and small businesses, small rural producers, self-employed professionals and other associates. We did all this without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. CEHBFIO IVIECFDECOHDITI O In the last Two years later, inflation reemerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March of this year, worsened this situation, as it raised the prices of several commodities even further, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to overcome the wave of the Omicron variant, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, sectors economies more linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion. The growth of the physical service network is aligned with the objectives of being close to meet the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2,300 branches, in more than 1,600 municipalities, with Linica being a physically present financial institution in more than 200 of these. This expansion is also reflected in the number of members and in the month of June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% compared to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new members. Emphasis Institutional With roots in the countryside, and a long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 23rd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness. Also, this semester, we ranked 43rd among the best financial institutions in Brazil in the World's Best Banks 2022 ranking, carried out by Forbes in partnership with Statista. Our members will have a solid cooperative financial institution with evaluation from the main agencies of risk classification in the world, having an AA (bra) rating from Fitch and a “Strong” rating for its Asset, also granted by the agency. It is also rated by Moody’s (Aal) and Standart & Poor’s (AAA). /Z/\ 39 Programs and initiatives Our commitment to the regions where we are present goes beyond financial services, including encouraging general and financial education through programs and initiatives, diversity, youth protagonism, among others themes. Collaborating with development and generating positive impact in the regions where we operate has been based on premises since our founding. Our main social programs are focused especially on cooperation, education and local development. Acknowledgments Even in a scenario of uncertainty due to the global economic crisis, we remain present and active in economic and social contributions to the communities where we operate. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for dedication and work continues. Together we will continue building a more prosperous society.
