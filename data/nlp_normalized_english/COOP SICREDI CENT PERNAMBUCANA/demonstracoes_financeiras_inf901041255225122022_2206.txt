In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above fairly present, in all material respects, the position of the Cooperative on December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Bank Central do Brasil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to substantiate our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. ,4 EY Building a better working world Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined were necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis | in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. You Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance | that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level| of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism towards the audit. In addition: o We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. o We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. Cooperative. o We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. o We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the ability to operational continuity of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity. o We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasilia, March 24, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F 'I _'/7/'/ rl(“'i>i'4([i;/' Renata Zanotta Calgada ' Accountant CRC-RSO62793/O-8 Administration Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (0 Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March of this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% — 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and must continue at this level raised until half of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advance of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of the restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase of default and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, legal entities and rural producers. In our model of operation, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlighted the following administrative facts: we carried out communication actions aimed at expanding knowledge of our business model and offered several credit granting campaigns aimed at supporting our members with financial demands. Furthermore, we participate in events with some segments of society, promoting the spread of cooperativism and attracting new members. In order to ensure greater comfort in the premises of our agencies and offices, we renovated the Medical Center Business Office, transforming it into a space that reflects our technological transformations and close service. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our founding. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: Thinking about the impacts of our business in the environmental, social and economic areas and linked to Sicredi's Sustainability Policy, we implemented the Local Sustainability Committee to initiate the actions of systemic social programs, as well how to guide the Board of Administration in making decisions observing sustainable development. During the year, we also carried out financial education activities for our employees and female entrepreneurs from the rural region of Pernambuco. In December, we held another edition of Christmas + So|ida'rio, where we donated toys to needy children in local institutions, donated by our associates. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized rankings and national awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Economico, Best Companies to Work For, from Vocé S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had our corporate rating upgraded by Moody's.
