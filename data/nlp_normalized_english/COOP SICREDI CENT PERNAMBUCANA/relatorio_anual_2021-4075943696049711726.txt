We are experiencing an atypical year, marked by the partial and unorthodox recovery of the world economy and our country. The inflation dragon hit all economies, including the most stable ones, with the IPCA, the country's official inflation indicator, ending 2021 at 10.06"/o. This result was above the target ceiling established by the National Monetary Council, of 5.25%, being the highest in six years. The financial market revised the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021, setting it at around 4.6%, below the forecast of almost 5.0%, previously announced. Due to this economic environment, the Selic rate closed the year at 9.25% p.a., after the seventh consecutive increase, reaching the highest level in just over four years, negatively affecting the consumption, the cost of credit and funding from financial institutions. Despite the economic adversity, Sicredi Centro Pernambucana fulfilled its credit intermediary role, closing the year with RS 210.3 million in assets, in addition to a credit portfolio of RS 118.1 million and RS 73.8 million invested in financial markets. The cooperative’s sources of resources, characterized by member deposits and net assets, reached, respectively, RS 140.0 and RS 54.4 million. In the midst of all these circumstances, in 2021, the cooperative's surplus reached almost RS 3.2 million. The year 2021 was also marked by the expansion of Sicredi Centro Pernambucana, with the inauguration of new branches in the cities of Belo Jardim and Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, highlighting it with its pioneering character and pioneering new plagues, expanding its social framework to 8,653 members. Sicredi Centro Pernambucana, as the main financial institution of its associates, and holds a range of financial products and services that can bring peace of mind to its members in this turbulent context, holding a portfolio of products that covers savings, insurance, private pensions, credit cards, loans and financing with competitive rates, in addition to of applications more attractive than those inherent to the banking market — guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund — up to RS 250 million|per CPF or CNPJ. As a pioneering credit union in In the interior of Pernambuco, our cooperative has favored the social mobility of members, banking inclusion, improved quality of life, becoming known as an instrument of development in the region. In 2022, we will continue the growth of the cooperative, with a bold action plan, which seeks to emphasize the domain of the member's experience, providing a wide range of financial products and services. Anibal Cantarelli Chairman of the Board of Directors. 7 Annual Report2021 Sicredi Centro Pernambucana Message from the Executive Board In 2021, we are experiencing a year of clear challenges for the administration of Sicredi Centro Pernambucana. The persistence of the Covid19 pandemic' The stagnation of the economy in our region, which profoundly influenced the conditions for the search and release of credit' The resurgence of inflation, which measured by the IPCA reached two digits, forcing the BACEN to adopt a austerity monetary policy, increasing the Selic rate, with direct repercussions on the financial market, affecting the operational results of all institutions operating in it. The sum of these factors imposed actions on the management of our cooperative that ensured the maintenance of our operational focus on providing all services to meet the needs of our members. In this confrontation, we continue with our strategy aimed at the efficiency of our liquidity, to maintain credit rates accessible and with our commitment to promoting the economy with the security of our risk indicators. Systemic challenges were pursued and directed towards seeking the principality of our associates, with the purpose of implementing a business architecture with the associate as the central point. A new business model, built and directed towards the advancement of the digital reality imposed on the financial system, with emphasis on the physical expansion model of our agencies, resuming the pioneering spirit of Centro Pernambucana, translated into the inauguration of two new service points in Belo Jardim and Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, important cities in our area of ​​activity. In addition, the offer of our products and services on our digital platforms, providing opportunities for everyone our associates can manage their businesses quickly and safely, promoted by the use of SICREDI systemic tools. Such achievements would not be possible without the engagement of the employees who with capacity, skill and professionalism, absorbed all adversities, transforming them into opportunities to improve relationships with our associates' In 2022, with the support and strategic direction of our Board of Directors , we will remain firm in seeking to achieve our strategic goals, the continued adaptation of the cooperative to the systemic model and the purpose of relevance of our brand in the communities where we act, To all these challenges, we incorporate sustainability benchmarks, in which development will give us the ability to meet the needs of the current generation, without compromising the ability to meet the needs of future generations. This has been our work. A constant challenge, always under the aegis of true cooperative principles, tirelessly, analyzing and closely monitoring the market, improving our mission of being more than a Bank. After all, we are a credit cooperative, we are SICREDI Centro Pernambucana, where TOGETHER WE ARE STRONGER!

Our cooperative has had an important increase in its business and membership, where each person's vote has equal weight in decisions, without correlation with the individual volume of resources taken or applied, “hey, we are all owners of the business”. The positive result generated returns to the associates and, therefore, to the community. In addition, we opened 2 new Service Points in the cities of Be|oJardime and Santa Cruz do Capibaribe.

Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. 49 Féeiafér/0 Annual 2021 Sicredi Centro Pernambucann Independent Audit Opinion Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the values ​​corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits to financial intermediation revenue, due to the nature of the operations and (ii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenditure and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​referring to the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 — Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification. Our opinion does not contain any reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the board and governance for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Bank Central do Brasil — Bacen and the internal controls that it determined were necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error . When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, the matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but is not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any relevant distortions existing. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: - We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain appropriate and sufficient audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from an error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, falsification, omission or intentional false representations. 51 Annual Report 2021 Sicredi Centro Pernambucann Independent Audit Opinion - We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls . - We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. - We concluded on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that could raise significant debt in relation to the company's operational continuity capacity. Cooperative. If we conclude that there is relevant uncertainty, we must draw attention to it in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity. - We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the Financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.
