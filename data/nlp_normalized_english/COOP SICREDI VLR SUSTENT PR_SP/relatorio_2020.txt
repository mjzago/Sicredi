We are one of the 108 cooperatives that are part of Sicredi, the first cooperative financial institution in Brazil. We are part of a national system, made up of more than 4.91 million members who jointly decide the direction of the business and form a network that supports its prosperity with responsible financial solutions. In this report, you will find some of the actions and initiatives of 2020 and how we generated a positive impact for the associates, communities and regions in which we operate. Good reading! Chapter 1 PRESENTATION 6 Sicredi Valor Sustentável PR/SP 2020 Over more than thirty-one years, we have become accustomed, with fair joy, to the obligation to bring the member an annual x-ray of the cooperative, where each year was better than the previous one. And so it has been with the grace of God! And, we always do so, with the awareness of our duty fulfilled, as it is on this occasion that we highlight the performance of the cooperative, through succession of the main events that marked the life of the institution, framing the panorama of the year that has passed. Typically, planned events are, in one way or another, predictable. Changes do occur - however, they vary very little, because they are always within normally verifiable parameters. Understanding the cause and effect relationship is always easier when variations do not exceed the limits of everyday life! Not this time! This time, it was different! Very different! Two One thousand and twenty was a completely atypical year: it was indelibly marked in the history of the “Land of Men”, in the happy poetic expression of Saint-Exupéry. Plácido Caldas Filho, President of Sicredi Valor Sustentável PR/SP MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT7 Covid-19 has had such an impact on humanity that it has changed the course and order of things! Close to one million and eight hundred thousand people lost their lives around the world, victims of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite vaccines, which emerged in record time – In a supreme effort of science, we realized, however, that the nightmare was not over yet: there is still a complex situation where time is a fundamental factor. Governments of nearly two hundred states and nations fluctuate in uncertainty about how to effectively plan priorities that are fair and natural. The entire world already has a population of more than seven and a half billion souls. Everyone needs to be vaccinated. Production is not instantaneous. It takes time and resources. The question of logistics, transportation, storage of the vaccine, preparation of support teams and a wide variety of ancillary items such as needles, syringes, cotton, etc. For all of this, each country's planning will be complex, as there are a lot of people to be immunized! We discovered, more through anguish, that we hadn't done our homework; not even a “manual” on how to act preventively, quickly and safely, as everyone was and is involved! This “manual” continues to be established with the day-to-day experiences, when many tears continue to flow. The coronavirus pandemic simply paralyzed the planet, infecting everyone with an emotional/family insecurity never seen before. Suddenly, we go from the calm driver to the panicked passenger of an out-of-control car! And so it was! Then, and after assimilating the first impacts and their real consequences, we withdraw intimately to, in harmony with ourselves, reflect! It is in this magical moment that, realistic, we find the routes to solutions. It happened with some governments and institutions and, among them, Sicredi: both the Sicredi System and our cooperative, Sicredi Valor Sustentável, reacted with remarkable speed, serenity, courage and common sense. We had the responsibility to keep the house standing, running efficiently and safely for everyone. It is in these moments that leadership is tested. Leadership is not improvised, but perfected. We know that, at crucial times, Leadership makes all the difference. When the sky darkens, clouding the route of the stars, it is essential to find a flashlight that illuminates the path, calming and reassuring all passersby of evolution and constant trackers of the true north of hope! That's what you look for in a leader. And Sicredi proved to have many! Leaders who experience cooperativism. And that was how Sicredi valor Sustentável was tested with the pandemic of 2020, showing its value. The response had to be, and it was, quick! We had to reinvent ourselves, like our System did! We segregate and adapt physical spaces for some, and home offices for others. Technology has facilitated new methods of interaction. Virtual meetings were more efficient. Preserved distance, alcohol gel, responsibility and inseparable masks. The emotional health of the employee 8 Sicredi Valor Sustentável PR/SP 2020 was prioritized and the relief of tension was verified, in a model unique, made possible by our cooperative. In any case, this intense period of the pandemic, suddenly, we can summarize in a wonderful atmosphere created among us: people caring about people! And cooperativism in action. They are two sides of the same coin: the problem, which belongs to everyone and the solution, equally to everyone. The collective solution is always found on the paths of cooperativism, as the union achieved always solidifies as an effect of a noble cause: interdependence among men! It is at this level of consciousness that, when reached, cannot be surpassed by anything – it is full cooperativism! And when men reach this stage of collaboration, there is nothing that cannot be overcome. This is how we view the celebration of 2020, the result of which is in the following pages of this report: goals that were laboriously and largely exceeded, and a level of inner peace achieved by everyone, as each person, by cooperating, did “their part”. Despite everything, the life always fluctuates. It oscillates between pleasure and pain, between joy and sadness. It is the natural process of existence. And in two thousand and twenty, it was no different: we crossed the borders of joy through the new agencies, the competitions and victories in the “Arrancadão e Samurais da Recuperação de Crédito” and so much done for the associates and the communities. However, we also cross the borders of pain, in the tragic gap left by Washington, dear friend and companion on the journey sicrediana. These are the fluctuations in life that make us more mature and wise when faced with adversity. In cooperativism, as in society, we are eternally intertwined lives, woven together by the events dotted on the timeline! We always praise the flavor of our victories. The twenty-eight pioneers who founded more than thirty-one years ago were members of a sugar and alcohol cooperative, with one hundred and twenty-four members, - Cooperval -, which demonstrates the difficulties of a small cooperative. The passage of the years two thousand and twenty in particular demonstrates our possibilities for the years to come. We are no longer that fragile cooperative for many. We are already a cooperative with half a billion resources and growing rapidly. We have the most appropriate instrument for humanity to reach the desired level of prosperity: cooperativism! We are already part of the UN Global Compact and contribute to many development goals sustainable development of the same UN for two thousand and thirty. We will increasingly be at the service of our communities, bringing encouragement and knowledge to a fairer world. Our model, with Crescer, Pertencer, União Faz a Vida, the Youth Committee, the Women's Committee, makes this dream possible. No matter how much uncertainty the year two thousand and twenty-one brings us, we fear nothing: we came forged by two thousand and twenty! As cooperative members, we will continue to do “just our part”. Cooperating, we are spectators and protagonists at the same time! It just depends on us. Happy reading, Plácido Caldas Filho President9 31 years ago, through the vision of 28 members of Cooperval – Cooperative of Sugarcane and Alcohol Producers, Sicredi Valor Sustentável was born. A story that began in 1989 in the city of Jandaia do Sul – PR and that, to this day, carries the brand Valor Sustentável NOSSA COOPERATIVA of the determination and boldness of its founders.

This initiative is a call for companies to align their strategies and operations with 10 universal principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption, to develop actions that contribute to facing society's challenges. It is today the biggest corporate sustainability initiative in the world, with more than 13 thousand members in almost 80 local networks, covering 160 countries. Those who are part of the Global Compact also assume the responsibility of contributing to achieving the global sustainability agenda. In 2015, the 193 member countries of the United Nations approved, by consensus, the 2030 Agenda, whose main pillar is the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Due to the synergy between this agenda and the purpose of our System, Sicredi decided in COMMITMENT TO THE GLOBAL COMPACT27 January 2020, to formalize its adherence to the UN Global Compact. With this, we began to adopt the Ten Principles of the Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as guidelines for our sustainable development. Those who are part of the initiative also assume the responsibility of contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which make up the UN 2030 Agenda. As main channel with the private sector, the Global Compact's mission is to engage companies in this new development agenda. The SDGs are made up of 17 objectives. The guidelines of the Global Compact and the SDGs speak positively to Sicredi's position of building a more prosperous society together. All the principles of the Pact adhere to Sicredi's mission, vision and values, as well as being in synergy with the Code of Conduct and the Sustainability Policy.28 Sicredi Valor Sustainable PR/SP 2020 29 22 Graphic Project - Sicredi 2020Systemic Initiatives Throughout the report, when referring to systemic initiatives, we suggest that you use the official brands of the initiatives and the explanatory texts for each of them as follows: Aims to contribute to education integral role and the protagonism of children and adolescents through a teaching methodology that encourages the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship.

We always maintain the essence of cooperativism, seeking to understand the needs to serve our members. Our team is always growing. Close relationships are one of our main characteristics. “The year 2020 was undoubtedly a year in which we were faced with a series of challenges. We had to change in a short space of time our work strategy, in order to minimize the impacts of the pandemic on our daily lives. Our priority from the beginning has been the physical and emotional well-being of our employees, in which we have planned agile and effective actions since the beginning of the pandemic.” “And the result of all this care and reception comes through testimonials, messages and dialogues in which the employee feels like an integral part of a big family, in addition to the spectacular results that the Cooperative presented in the year of 2020. In 2021 we will continue to evolve in this purpose, understanding employees in their needs and working on the professional development of the entire team”.
