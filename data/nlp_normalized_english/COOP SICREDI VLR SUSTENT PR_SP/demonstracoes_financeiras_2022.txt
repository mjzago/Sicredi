Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion regarding this report. With the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise form, appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to achieve assurance reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the statements financial institutions, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations. understanding the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance respect, among other aspects, the planned scope, the timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, February 23, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, partnerships, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region . In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are the true owners of business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that area. community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This happens through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and in the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its high interest rate cycle in March this year with the fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50 %, and should continue to rise interest rates in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in world growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect The reopening of economic activity influenced good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the other hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in credit and the rise in prices . Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society The Valor Premiado Campaign was created, which aimed to increase the volume of fundraising, strengthening the Net Equity of the Cooperative and, consequently, boosting the economy of the regions in which we operate. The Campaign drew 17 0 km Fiat Mobi vehicles for members who participated in the Promotion, one unit per agency, with more than R$1 million in prizes. Another action taken with a view to having a positive impact on society was the opening of two new branches in São Paulo, in the cities of Franca (Agência Franca Progresso) and Pedregulho, which consolidates our presence in the State and enables us to develop new regions. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact on the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: •฀ Pertencer Program: we seek to engage members, establish participation rules and guide the participatory management model, encouraging participation in assemblies and decision-making processes. •฀ The Union Makes Life Program: we seek to promote the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship among children and adolescents.

Still regarding children, we have the “Financial Education Journey in Schools”, where our program is developed in schools through teachers themselves, with students from the 1st to 5th year of elementary school. Teachers went through training through the Sicredi Foundation, in order to enable them to develop financial education in accordance with the curricular matrix, aligned with the BNCC (National Common Curricular Base). We ended this with 8 municipalities participating in the program (Jandaia do Sul/PR, Marumbi/PR, Corumbataí do Sul/PR, Lidianópolis/PR, Ivaiporã/PR, Borrazópolis/PR, Novo Itacolomi/PR and Jardim Alegre/PR), 20 schools, 165 teachers, around 2500 students and more than 100 projects developed. •฀ Women's Committee: in In 2022 we were able to return to schools to continue PUFV's involvement. Even with all the difficulties faced when returning to school, we managed to develop great projects. There were 87 new teachers trained and 9 new schools starting in the program, thus totaling 41 schools, 258 teachers, 3,170 students and more than 250 projects developed. We ended the year with the Program present in 7 municipalities (Jandaia do Sul/PR, Marumbi/PR, Corumbataí do Sul/PR, Ivaiporã/PR, Borrazópolis/PR, Novo Itacolomi/PR and Jardim Alegre/PR). •฀ Youth Committee: in the youth committee, we also held workshops virtually, in which we worked on the themes: Leadership and Protagonism and Self-knowledge and Purpose. In addition to a gamified platform containing short courses on the topics already covered. And in December, we held a TEAL (Outdoor Experiential Training) Team Building, where we worked on aspects of leadership, cooperativeness, creativity and the emotional aspects of our young people, through dynamic activities, in addition to promoting integration among young people participating in the committee.
