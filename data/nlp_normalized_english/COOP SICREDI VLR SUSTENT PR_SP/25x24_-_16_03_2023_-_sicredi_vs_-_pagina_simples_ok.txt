Due to our cooperative nature, since our incorporation we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust Sustainability Strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. To guide our Sustainability Strategy, we established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.

However, we emphasize that this continuous success, regardless of the permanent challenge of navigating rough or placid waters, has a reason for being: both Sicredi Valor Sustentável and its 33 years, as well as the other 107 cooperatives that make up the Sicredi System, with its 120 years as of 12/28/2022 – the oldest in Latin America – demonstrate the same efficiency for many years in a row! Such a picture naturally leads us to the question: what is the secret of this model of cooperative organization whose unlimited expansion grows stronger with each passing moment? Yes, it is a model, whose fundamental coordinates tie together a structure destined for success! So, I share with you some reflections: is it possible that when an “enlightened” being sets an idea, materializing it, to the intense benefit of humanity, does he realize the scope in time that this same idea will bring to everyone? in the future? Whether we like it or not, the civilizing process depends on these “enlightened beings” that appear from time to time! Speaking of model, I am referring to the Raiffeisen model of Cooperativism of Credit, which we adopted and the majority of the world too! The German Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen, born in 1818, is one of those geniuses who came to light the way! He created simple but powerful solutions for the suffering farming communities of southern Germany! The basics: it was based on cooperation! If everyone cooperated with each other, everyone would benefit! I contemplated your fair and egalitarian model with three irreplaceable items: joint responsibility, impartial supervision and democratic management. Raiffeisen said that, outside of these assumptions, no society could be called fair! Let us note that his model includes the four words that, going deeper into their meanings, the power of the model explains itself! Cooperation, solidarity, supervision and democracy! Comparing with other existing systems, we quickly understand why our model is 120 years old! I return to the initial question: would Raiffeisen have understood the success of his model 200 years ahead of his time, today our time? Would he have seen the universalization of his credit model as it is today? This is how I see the size of the Sicredi System’s success, together with an unparalleled investment in human capital – its greatest asset – and technological support! To close with the circle; Treating a human being as a human being should be treated! To this end, deep immersion in the community, through committees, volunteering, and seeking, as we do today, the individual prosperity of each member and the prosperity of the community, where everyone is covered! This is the great discovery: by collaborating with the UN and its SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), we take on non-association too! Reflect, my friends: as long as there are people in need of every luck, we will never be happy! Our actions in communities, with numbers that speak for themselves represent the legacy of our model, as we are just at the beginning of a beautiful story, doing our part. Sicredi Valor Sustentável PR/SP left a trail of achievements in 2022 that makes us proud! 5 COOPERATIVA SICREDI VALOR SUSTAINÁVEL PR/SP 2022We highlight: • Delivery of 17 cars (one per agency), drawn on 12/17/2022, in the Valor Premiado Promotion; • Opening of the 4th branch in Franca/SP on 08/16/2022; • Opening of the Pedregulho/SP branch, on 12/14/2022; • The two winners of the Prize Savings, worth R$ 5 thousand reais each; • The six winners in the Capital Prize Promotion, worth R$ 10 thousand reais; • We promote intercooperation with the recycling cooperative in Ivaiporã/PR, during National Environment Week; • DAY C – in Jandaia do Sul (Caldo do Bem), with the delivery of R$ 30 thousand reais to the entities: Asilo São Vicente de Paulo, APMI and Associação Florart Vida; • Another 16 actions were carried out by agencies in DAY C; • Eight classes of entrepreneurs trained by Empreende Sicredi; • In the climate survey carried out by the company Great Place to Work, we obtained 1st place with 95% of a great environment to work; • We train employees in Humanized Leadership; • Formations of the Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Committee; • We approved the project for the new Headquarters that will begin in 03/2023, in clear proof of how much we have grown, reserving a library and a House of Memory for the community, demonstrating to our generations the difficulties faced by the pioneers.

It's a path of no return! This Credit Cooperative is becoming an educational institution where the citizens of tomorrow are forged in unbreakable temper, who, as today's generations demonstrate, certainly represent the hope of a better world, environmentally balanced and where life becomes diverse, happy and colorful. It's credit cooperativism, creating a better world!
