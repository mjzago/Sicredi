If, as a result of the work carried out, it is possible to conclude that there are relevant distortions in the administration report, we will only want to communicate these if f at o. We have no idea what to do with this respect. 2 Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for preparing and adequately presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to Cooperative continue to operate, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international standards audit process, always detects any relevant distortions that may exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that resulting from an error, as fraud may involve circumvention of internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.3  We conclude on the appropriateness of the board's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, February 25, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9Board of Directors and Board of DirectorsThe year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment to our mission aggregate income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offering solutions through electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, app), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we are back to operating face-to-face in all agencies, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, the main administrative events were the inauguration of the agency in Cruzmaltina (PR) and the beginning of our activities in the municipality of Grandes Rios (PR), continuing the cooperative's expansion plan. We also highlight the investments in the revitalization of our agencies, which enabled us to deliver to the Lidianópolis (PR) a more cozy, modern agency with privacy for service. Sicredi Valor Sustentável has its members as its reason for existing. Based on this, several initiatives promoted the economy, prosperity and local development. And, in 2021, the cooperative's work was recognized through the high degree of member dissatisfaction, which increased our NPS (Net Promoter Score) survey index to 74.6%. That's 7.63 percentage points more than the result of 2020, awarded the degree of excellence for the cooperative's services. On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. In 2021 we continue to care for the emotions of teachers participating in the “AUnião Faz a Vida” program. In the Financial Education section, we made significant progress with the Financial Education Journey within municipal schools, in addition to the various actions carried out in the community. Furthermore, we started the new format of the Youth Committee, we carried out the project “Inteiras para Mulherar o Mundo”, together with the Women Committee, and trained our employees to take the “Empreenda Sicredi” program to micro and small entrepreneurs, among other social businesses.

National Financial - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Law nº 4,595 /64 and nº5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows of intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as per understanding previously adopted, and should be considered as income and revenue from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which the statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to non-operating income or losses is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the natural balances in the groups of accounts of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, for the purpose of favoring the comparability of financial statements. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules. Sicredi, as of December 31, 2021, is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network with 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates in 17 service points.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, The following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents:r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realization or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in payment of a principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00 of the CMN. The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 07; II- Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for demands of a fiscal, civil, tax and labor through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of disbursements by the entity for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. Details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 16; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV- Measurement of the effects resulting from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of the market and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. The details of the impacts are presented in the NOTE 32.Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, finalized in court. Contingent assets with probable successes are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success.

The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties resulting from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal regulations and external, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's staff; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on the Institution's risk and control culture; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of activities of the institution and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to assess, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the business continuity strategies adopted are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard provide for the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of entities.I - Capital Management Structure For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital held by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. Processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with best practices market, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risk appetite, aiming to maintain capital for support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors; The guarantees provided include operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to members via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor under a contract signed between the parties. The amounts are mostly made up of Finame and BNDES programs.
