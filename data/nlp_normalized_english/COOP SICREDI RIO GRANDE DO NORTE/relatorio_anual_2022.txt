This becomes even clearer when we analyze the challenges of the past year, which were all faced and overcome by the cooperative format and, especially, by the Sicredi System. In fact, for the second year in a row, we were featured in the global consultancy Great Place to Work (GPTW – Excellent Place to Work), which placed us with an even higher confidence index than in 2021. After the very tough test of a global pandemic , we witnessed the outbreak of disturbing factors such as the energy crisis, geopolitical instability and, certainly, the most complex of these, the Russia-Ukraine conflict. At the national level, we had all the turbulence of an elective period with many polarizations, heated emotions and hasty decisions, which are reflected in the country's socioeconomic chemistry, with impressive consequences. In addition to all this, what was the concrete record of our Sicredi System? Simply that: we gained more than 1 million new members in 2022, totaling more than 6.4 million people. The data represents a 15% increase in the member base compared to the end of 2021. It is worth mentioning that the Rio Grande do Norte context reached an even higher percentage, as we jumped to the level of 15 thousand members, 3 thousand more than the previous year, that is , an increase of 25%. Another unequivocal example of the reliability and robustness of our financial operations was the achievement of the maximum rating from the Moody’s agency, which raised, in 2022, Sicredi’s rating to AAA, placing our System at the top of the rankings. This type of assessment demonstrates, once again, that we have one of the safest and least risky credit profiles on the market, with low default rates and solid profitability. Another reflection of our sustainable business model, which continues to demonstrate growth and capacity. And this support comes from the large volume of deposits from members, which, in 7 years, doubled in size. In Rio Grande do Norte, Sicredi had a excellent year. For the second time in a row, we ended the period as the most efficient cooperative in the System, with extreme fidelity to the institutional guideline of “think global and act local”. Our main vector of activity, the expansion of the physical network, was, once again, the main highlight of the period. With the opening of branches in Pau dos Ferros, São Gonçalo do Amarante, Goianinha and Assú, we consolidated our operations in all regions of the state, with 9 branches modern “embracing” hundreds of new entrepreneurial audiences and dozens of municipalities and communities, all eager for the financial solutions and opportunities that credit unions have to offer. We know, through a study carried out in partnership with the Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (Fipe)1, that where there is a credit cooperative, compared to where there is not, the GDP is higher (5.6%), more job vacancies formal jobs are created (6.2%) and the number of commercial establishments grows (15.7%). This is because, in addition to good rates, compatible income and more than 300 differentiated products and services, people still prefer personal and reliable service, in addition to taking the lead in their decisions. And we offer and do this with excellence, bringing together the human and technological sides, in order to create increasingly lasting bonds with people and companies. Therefore, we start our journey in 2023 strongly confident and with an emotional addition that encourages us even more: the celebration of 30 years of our operations in Rio Grande do Norte. Time to value the healthy relationship we have with the land of Rio Grande do Norte, translated into our environmental actions and the simplest projects, such as two that I highlight here: our beloved Solidarity Christmas (for children undergoing cancer treatment) and the partnership with the NGO Attitude Cooperation (football schools for young people and material donations musical and educational). I emphasize that this happy trajectory would not be possible without the decisive participation of our dear associates and the exemplary engagement of our team of collaborators. To everyone, my sincere thanks, which represents the feeling of our entire administrative board. Let us move forward, optimistic, active and always together. Greetings cooperative members! Damião Monteiro Neto Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte 1 Benefits Economics of Credit Cooperativism in the Brazilian Economy (FIPE, Dec/2019).6 Sicredi018SICREDI 120 years of SicrediCooperativism: In 2022, Sicredi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. Nova Petrópolis Rural Credit Cooperative – Cooperural, founded in 1902, the first credit cooperative in South America. 9Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851 Since he was young, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and Holland, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. Of countryside arrived in the cities, maintaining over time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all associates and promoting quality of life.

Sicredi becomes a Member of the UN Global Compact. Completion of the migration process of cooperatives and Central Sicredi North/Northeast. Migration became a milestone in our history not only because of the expansion itself, but also because of the way it was developed, based on the systemic integration of different cultures. 12Who were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and who govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact: Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer salary accounts mandatory for its employees, in a credit cooperative membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvement, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region. Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to their members.THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Free and voluntary membership Democratic management Interest in the community Intercooperation1 2 7 6O SICREDIOassociates participate in the economic result of the cooperative, or In other words, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. The education, training and information of members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação Program in Ponta do Lápis, which trains cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their community.Economic participation of members Autonomy and independence Education, training and information 3 4 5 SICREDI RIO GRANDE DO NORTE 202214Our cooperative essence By exercising our active role of associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to make your dreams come true, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and is transformed into the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote the business of members, the growth of the community and the development of the people of the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism is a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: VIRTUOSO CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISMO SICREDI15As you can see, the solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. I can only thank Sicredi for always being there when we need and for conducting our investments with clarity and credibility. We will continue on this successful path together. Regina Jales Associate Sicredi “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good”. Who We Are 16We are Sicredi, the first cooperative financial institution in Brazil, with more than 120 years of history. Our business model builds a value chain that benefits the member, the cooperative and the local community, creating a virtuous cycle where everyone has a say and a voice, where everyone wins. Today, we have more than 6 million members. Each of them holds a small share of the cooperative, influencing decisions and participating in the results. We offer more than 300 financial products and services in a simple and accessible way, and this is how we are present throughout the country, highlighting that, in more than 200 municipalities, we are the only financial institution available. We believe that doing together it makes a difference and that the strength of the collective is capable of transforming our world. Therefore, we support initiatives that aim to develop each location, with transformative and sustainable solutions. The harmonious relationship we build between the individual and the collective, between associates and communities, is one of the essential values ​​of our work. And he has already demonstrated enough success, demonstrating, year after year, that people who cooperate grow. More information is available at www.sicredi.com.br.

Corporate RatingsSolidity is one of our main differentiatorsTHE SICREDIOur Cooperative0222Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte is proud to be part of the extensive network of 106 cooperatives that form the Sicredi System. In 2022, we celebrate 29 years of a history of pioneering and dedication to credit cooperatives in Rio Grande do Norte and, in this report, we present our results and progress regarding the past year. Revisiting the past, the first lines of our trajectory were written on May 6, 1993, when we had only 29 members. All of them in search of a financial alternative that would share the results in a fairer and more rewarding way. Initially, our activities were restricted to medical professionals. But six years later, in 1999, we had already opened our own headquarters, in Natal, in the Petrópolis neighborhood. As new members arrived, our experience grew and decisions became bolder. In 2003, we incorporated the remaining health professionals and, shortly thereafter, carried out crucial renovations and expansions at our headquarters, with a view to future improvements. These came in various forms, the most relevant fact being the coverage, in 2008, of employees in the legal area, which resulted in another leap in growth. Year after year, we saw the incredible capacity of credit unions to offer truly appropriate and effective solutions to various human and business realities. However, we still needed to reach a level that would bring us the security and confidence necessary to consolidate our expectations. This opportunity finally arrived in 2018, when we became the first state reference cooperative in the Sicredi System. From then on, we began an ongoing project and sustainable way of serving new audiences and expanding our physical network. The objective was to take our financial solutions even further, based on a relationship of proximity, agility and efficiency. Supported by responsible strategic planning, we once again opened our membership, this time including higher education professionals in the areas of Science and Arts. Shortly afterwards, we adopted the cooperative model of free membership, a time in which we already we had more than 10 thousand members. At the same time, the expansion of our physical network has become the most evident symbol of our growth and strength. We opened units in the largest cities in the interior of the state, such as Mossoró, Parnamirim, Caicó and Currais Novos, and became the 1st state reference cooperative in the entire Sicredi System. In the following years, we implemented structural reforms at our headquarters in Natal and a modern monitoring and control system, covering the operations of all agencies in real time. All of this created safe conditions for Sicredi Rio Grande do NorteOUR COOPERATIVA23for a new stage of growth in 2022, with the opening of branches in Pau dos Ferros, São Gonçalo do Amarante, Goianinha and Assú, strongly establishing our presence in all regions of Rio Grande do Norte. Today, we have more than 15 thousand members and our financial solutions reach more than 50 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul, through 9 agencies strategically installed in the most important population centers. Another valuable differentiator is our team of employees, made up of more than 160 members, all with a high level of engagement and qualification. We remain confident and optimistic, practicing conscious cooperativism, which disseminates human protagonism and prosperity in the regions where we operate. We wish to continue to positively impact these various social and economic realities in the state potiguar, strengthening the dreams and projects of countless people, companies and communities, with the clear aim of building a better, more prosperous and truly fair world. And we want to do it together, with more and more dreams, voices and ideas.

That's why C Day was created, a powerful national volunteer movement, based on cooperation, sharing people's time and knowledge. In 2022, Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte participated in another edition of Cooperate Day, with donations of cleaning materials, non-perishable food and personal hygiene products, delivered by members and employees and donated to charities in municipalities across our state. In the regions where it operates, Sicredi offers a cooperative education front, open to everyone: members, non-members, counselors and collaborators. Through enriching experiences, guided by the Development Goals UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), together with our principles, people know more about how we work, which sparks the interest of many. In 2022, the Crescer Program was also part of the Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte calendar and is its main initiative in the educational field. More than 150 employees were informed and educated Day C (Cooperate Day) Crescer Program HIGHLIGHTS OF 2022 Best Financial Institution in Rio Grande do Norte In December 2022, Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte had the joy of being awarded the Regional Leaders of Brazil Award, which chose it as the Best Financial Institution in the state.

At the same time, we will begin a new strategic phase, to bring even more modernity to the regions served. Smart, low-cost solutions focused on digital services will expand the area of ​​coverage, attracting new members and promoting hundreds of businesses. All this, based on environmental and financial sustainability, and the most innovative technology. In addition to strengthening the service of already established agencies, specialized consultants will be actively prospecting around each regional hub. This will mean, in the medium term, an even greater reach for Sicredi, bringing opportunities to many municipalities. These are communities that, although small, have great potential for growth and entrepreneurship through credit cooperatives. Employee qualification and engagement will continue to be priorities. In addition to Intensifying the action of digital channels, Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte will continue to focus on creating a positive work environment, with motivated professionals involved with our principles. Furthermore, throughout 2023, the implementation of the Pertencer e Crescer programs is planned, which are born from the essence of cooperativism, aiming for a better understanding of cooperative education and the participation of all. In short, we have every reason to continue growing, through a healthy, conscious and transformative credit cooperative. It is good to remember that we have reached the status of the largest cooperative financial institution in Rio Grande do Norte and the most efficient in the Sicredi System by planning lucidly and carrying out things together. Let's strengthen this bond and embrace the opportunities of the future!35Board of Directors We decide together, sharing responsibilities and results. Our associates elect, every four years, the members of the Board of Directors, which guides and supervises management so that its actions meet the interests of members and other interested parties. Therefore, this Council is responsible for establishing the general and strategic direction and objectives of the Cooperative. The Cooperative, as it is affiliated with a Central, participates in choosing the members of its Board of Directors and Board of Directors. Furthermore, the Cooperative and the Central are part of SicrediPar, which is a holding company responsible for definition of Sicredi System strategies. Through this participatory management, associates influence decisions throughout the system. Fiscal Council During the General Assembly, members of the Fiscal Council are also elected, a body that monitors compliance with the administration's legal and statutory duties. Board of Directors Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte's Board of Directors is appointed by the Board of Directors and is responsible for the executive management of the business. Participatory management of cooperative Associates (elect) do Norte make it possible to offer a differentiated mix of products and services. These are modern solutions and intelligent, which make the lives of our members and/or their companies easier in its most varied aspects. With responsibility and transparency, our products help, among many things, to organize people's financial lives, access credit and financing at fair and competitive rates, use the most advanced and safe technologies in their daily lives, in addition to the fact that investing in Cooperative is to contribute to the development of the region itself. Next, we present this differentiated line of solutions and service channels, ready to meet the diverse desires and expectations of our members: For you Credit Exchange Cards Payments Consortiums Insurance Digital certification Investments Accreditation Current account PensionsFor your company39Internet banking application Telephone services24-Hour Bank WhatsApp Enterprise Promote education financial Within the perspective of “thinking globally and acting locally”, each person It is a protagonist agent of its own history, and must evolve in a shared and sustainable way, with truly beneficial results for the present and future of its realities. For this reason, Sicredi stands alongside everyone, through frequent educational actions, aimed at associates, employees, suppliers and the community. One of the essential fields is the continuous valorization of financial education, which promotes the conscious use of resources, management balanced finances and responsible use of the products and services offered. In the same way, Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte, inspired by the principles of our cooperative system, encourages positive transformation in the region in which it operates. ENEF Week With wide publicity on its social networks, Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte joined the movement to encourage and promote financial education, carried out by the Sicredi System, through the 9th National Financial Education Week (Week ENEF). The awareness actions took place from December 12th to 18th, 2022, as always in a very relaxed format and with completely free access. The approach was made through the web series “Yes or No, Money in Hand”. Composed of three episodes, the series parodied auditorium programs in which the participant, inside a booth, had to answer “yes” or “no” to the presenter's questions, without knowing what was happening on stage. During ENEF Week, the episodes were launched on Sicredi's social networks such as YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, and also published on the website. The content was based on Sicredi's Financial Education program, called “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis”, using everyday examples to show the importance of knowledge in our financial choices. A special live was also held, following the same theme, lasting approximately 50 minutes. Content Pills and Personal Finance Tips enriched the videos, dealing with subjects such as impulse purchases, budget organization and extra income.Canais40 Promote eco-efficient management The solid expansion of Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte is largely due to the clarity of our environmental performance, fully aligned with sustainability . And when we talk about “sustainability”, our reference is broad: sustainable finance, green and low-carbon economy, businesses with a positive social impact and promoting the local economy. Therefore, it is very natural that all our products and services carry this content, in order to generate value for associates, employees, the community and other interested parties. We also believe that a “sustainable attitude” must be found in the smallest internal actions and decisions, including simple routine procedures. For example, in 2022, we implemented operational improvements that resulted in gigantic paper savings. In the registration sector, we reformulated the registration process closing of accounts, where, previously, there was a need to print numerous documents, just to prove the steps. Nowadays, these files are only saved on the network. In the credit sector, the same thing. We eliminate all printouts of member registration documents (Income Tax, Billing Declaration, PGDAS, Financial Statements, etc.).RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS41Solar Energy as an example of sustainability and economy One of the biggest Symbols of our socio-environmental concern continue to be the encouragement of the implementation of solar energy projects. We all know that photovoltaic energy is a clean, renewable and inexhaustible source. Thus, Sicredi offers members, whether individuals or legal entities, financing for up to 120 months to purchase equipment and technology for solar capture in their homes or businesses. With competitive rates and amounts credited directly to the supplier's account, the Credit is quickly approved and payment can be made in installments according to the contractor's payment capacity. In most cases, these are monthly amounts smaller than electricity bills. As this is a subject rich in perspectives and operational details, we provide specialized consultants (in our agencies or on site) for advice, measuring results and correct hiring. It is estimated that, in 5 years, due to the savings made, the investment will be paid off. Furthermore, in cases of production exceeding consumption needs, it is possible to accumulate credits for future discounts. In other words, a product/investment that has all the essential characteristics of our cooperative practice: sustainable, eco-efficient and socially responsible.4243Local Development0644Sicredi combines sport, tourism stimulation and respect for the environment With the Sol Half Marathon, an event sponsored by Sicredi Rio Big of North and carried out in conjunction with several business and government partners, tourism in Rio Grande do Norte has a “renewed momentum” in the month of September. In the last edition, 8 thousand athletes participated, but around half of them came from other Brazilian states. Many combine their presence in the competition with the unique opportunity to discover and experience the beauty of the land of Rio Grande do Norte. Thus, there is an undeniable increase in the tourism sector, boosting the economy and generating several employment and income opportunities. Sicredi is proud to be able to contribute to sport, people's health and well-being, through what is one of the best street racing experiences in the country. And to provide the full service, during and after the race, and also the following day, right at dawn, the teams collect the materials left on the route, in all sections and at Arena das Dunas, combining the grand sporting celebration with clean streets, clear conscience and protected environment.

Christmas, March 30, 2023. Permanent Alternate Fiscal Councilors Silvio José de Lucena Dantas (coordinator) Felipe Costa de Andrade Marinho Gaugefran José Guedes de SouzaRicardo Luiz Araújo de Sá Carlos Magno Pinheiro do Carmo Jorge Luiz Simonetti de Carvalho0988Independent Audit OpinionINDEPENDENT AUDIT OPINION Report of the independent auditor on the financial statements To the Administrators, Advisors and Cooperative Members of the Credit Cooperative - Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte Natal - RN Opinion We examined the financial statements of the Credit Cooperative - Sicredi Rio Grande do Norte “Cooperativa”) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows cash for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended on that date. , in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion.1089Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Report of the administration. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, appears to be significantly distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to achieve assurance reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements.90As part of the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise judgment professional and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or false representations intentional. • We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. • We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the accounting basis for operational continuity and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.
