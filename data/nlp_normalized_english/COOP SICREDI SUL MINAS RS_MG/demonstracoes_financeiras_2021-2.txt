In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Sul Minas do Rio Grande do Sul e Minas Gerais - Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities under such standards are described in the following section entitled “Auditor’s Responsibilities for Auditing Financial Statements.” We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding amounts We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for revenue from financial intermediation, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Policies Accounting, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification. Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise otherwise, it appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. No We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements free from distortion material, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on said statements. financial. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, as well as obtain appropriate audit evidence and enough to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We have obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative’s internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the ability to continue as a going concern operation of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit engagements and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Restatement of comparative figures: The administration is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, a reclassification of inflows of intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating revenue. Cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and must be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, so this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, for the purpose of favoring the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income funds and multimarket, which have immediate convertibility into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify them as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the initial and final cash equivalent of the period ending on December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of bonds and securities where were previously presented. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of legislation relevant, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules.

The structure also has five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Sicredi Cooperatives (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”).

OFGCoop has the purpose of providing a guarantee for credits in cases of intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity operations with these institutions.

Fund shares are valued daily, through the value of the share, published by the fund administrator on the CVM and ANBIMA website. 165,644 Rural and agro-industrial financing 15 45,228 193,702 111,007 349,952 218,076 Financing 72 3,379 20,552 46,083 70,086 56,875 Discounted loans and securities 2,756 34,417 96,188 181,936 315,297 57 Securities and credits receivable (Note 8) - 18,103 6,985 20 25,108 13,966 Debtors for the purchase of valuables and goods - 6 18 8 32 440,595 Guarantees and guarantees honored 25 - - - 25 52 Total credit operations 2,843 83,024 310,442 339,026 735,335 Total non-current 339,054 202,891 Total current 421,446 251,779 14,075 Total portfolio 2,868 101,133 317,445 339,054 760,500 454,670 Total other credits 25 18,109 7,003 28 25,165 31 /12/2020 AA - 16,162 13,320 - - b) Composition of the credit portfolio by risk levels Risk levels % ProvisionCredit operations and Other credits Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 12/31/2021 C 3.00 58,546 53,950 1.756                                            1.618 B 1,00                                        385.472                             206.610                                         3.854                                            2.066 A 0,50                                        273.347                             151.836                                         1.366                                               759  F 50,00                                            1.740 1.221                                            870                                               610 E 30,00                                            5.296                                  5.870                                         1.589                                            1.761 D 10,00                                          14.439                                13.579                                         1.444                                            1.358  Total 760.500                             454.670                                      15.838                                          15.995 H 100,00                                            3.698                                  6.746                                         3.698                                            6.746 G 70,00                                            1.800                                  1.538                                         1.261 1,077 Total Portfolio Total PortfolioUp to 3 months 3 to 12 months Over 12 months Individuals 1,898 33,715 58,922 138,447 As provided in Art. 5th of BACEN Resolution No. 4,800/20, the provision in the face of loss for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must only apply to the amount equivalent to the Equity allocated for this purpose, these values ​​are being presented together with the amount provisioned for credit operations and other credits.
