Euzébio José Rodigheiro PresidentAdemir José Simioni Vice-PresidentFORWARD: COOPERATIVISM IS PART OF OUR DNAMessage from the Presidency Gratitude for the past year and that in 2022 we can sow and reap good fruits! 9 The year 2021 was challenging and special for Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG and everyone who is part of it. A year that started full of uncertainty. After all, what would happen with the pandemic? Which recovery capacity of the economy? How would society and people be after a long period of social isolation? Feelings that were present in everyone. On the other hand, there was a great desire to make things happen and to make an effective contribution to society. With the spirit of doing good and generating prosperity, day-to-day decisions were made and, now, at the end of the year, we see that we managed to fulfill our aspirations. We actively participated in the regional economic recovery by increasing the volume of credit granted by more than 80%, a value that exceeded R$1 billion, in November 2021; we transfer resources from federal government and BNDES programs; we increased international partnerships with resources from the IDB and IFC; among other actions. All of this was possible due to the trust of our members, considering that the volume of resources deposited increased by more than 40% and were completely reinvested in the local economy. Our financial result was the best ever, strengthening reserves and increasing the capacity to grant credit, as well as a portion going directly to members proportional to their transactions. We thank everyone and reiterate our commitment to always doing our best every day. We allocate resources from the Social Fund to health, public safety and education, as they are fundamental pillars for sustainable development. Per Ultimately, between challenges and achievements, the feeling is one of satisfaction and duty accomplished. Our team is more prepared and motivated than ever to make 2022 the best year ever and continue to “make a difference in people's lives by providing development and making dreams come true”.

It was on that date that 22 men from society met with the intention of creating a credit cooperative. Thanks to the entrepreneurial vision of these men, the Getúlio Rural Credit Cooperative was founded Vargas – Credigel. In a short time, Credigel was already showing signs of growth, and, in 1992, it was renamed Sicredi Estação. In 2018, with the expansion process to the state of Minas Gerais, it was renamed Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG. In 2021 we celebrate four decades of history, which was written with the help of many people and all guided by the same values: cooperativism and courage. In this sense, it is also possible to say that we celebrate 40 years of actions that make the difference in the lives of associates, society and the communities in which we are present. To celebrate this important commemorative date with members, the “40 years of Cooperation” prize campaign was launched in March, in which 468 draws worth R$500 and 2 draws worth R$40 thousand in savings were made available. . The awards, which took place weekly, ended in December and included a large number of members from Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul. Among the actions to celebrate the cooperative's anniversary, the “MovimentAÇÃO do Bem” campaign was also launched. The initiative allows each member, when making a financial investment or savings deposit, to benefit a charity of their choice. Thus, the campaign meets the values ​​of cooperativism, allowing a difference to be made in the communities in which we operate and consolidating that “Together, we are TRANSFORMATION”. Various initiatives were held in 2021 for the benefit of communities, both in Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul. Given this scenario, the strength of cooperativism was proven, once again, and that, above all, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG takes seriously its purpose of “making a difference in people's lives, providing development and making dreams come true”. Such contributions, economic and social, would not be possible if 40 years ago our founding members had not started this project. Therefore, as a way of recognizing and thanking the pioneers of the cooperative, on December 16, 2021, an event was held to honor those responsible for its foundation.40 YEARS OF HISTORY AND COOPERATION1540 YEARS OF HISTORY AND COOPERATION Founding members and representatives receive trophy for 40 years of the Cooperative Founding members: Adão Russi de Oliveira Albino Luiz Scariot (in memorian) Aldino Beledelli Angelo Armindo Webber (in memorian) Armando Comin Athaides Pazza (in memorian) Meet some winners of the 40th anniversary awards campaign: Cacildo Luiz Gaiatto (in memorian) Carlos Alberto Gradin Daniel José Caramori Darcilo Ivo Giacomazzi (in memorian) Dieter Ludwig Oswald (in memorian) Dionisio Tonial (in memorian) Domingos Pedro Ceconello (in memorian) Enio MeregaliIldo Bernardon Italo Brasil Pedrolo (in memorian) Ivalino Sana (in memorian) Jovino Martin Urio Juarez Caigaro Pinheiro (in memorian) Leonel João Peruzolo (in memorian) Otávio Ciro Boff Severino Beledelli 16 17EXPANSION AND CONSOLIDATION Attentive to the needs of its members and seeking to be increasingly closer, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG reopened its agency in the city of Erebango/RS. Designed with a modern design, the new agency aims to offer more personalized service, as well as greater comfort and convenience to Erebanguense members. With immense joy and a commitment to contributing to local development, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG continued with its expansion project on Minas Gerais soil. In 2021, it was the turn of the municipalities of Divinópolis and São Sebastião do Oeste to enjoy the benefits of cooperativism, personalized and close service, as well as enjoying differentiated products and services. Reopening of the agency in Erebango/RS Openings in Minas Gerais, in the cities of Divinópolis and São Sebastião do Oeste Agency in the city of Erebango/RS Agency in the city of São Sebastião do Oeste/MG Agency in city ​​of Divinópolis/MG 18 Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG operates through the União Faz a Vida Program (PUFV) in 8 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul, namely: Erebango, Estação, Floriano Peixo - to, Getúlio Vargas, Ipiranga do Sul, Jacutinga, Quatro Irmãos and Sertão, and, in Minas Gerais, the municipality of Pimenta was the first to receive the program. In November 2021, it was agreed between leaders of Santo Antônio do Monte to start the program in that municipality. At cooperative, there are approximately 2,800 students and 350 teachers impacted by PUFV, working and developing more than 160 projects in 9 municipalities in the two states in which Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG operates. Furthermore, during the school year, several works were carried out in schools, these being through projects, en -When we invest in people, we increase their chance of making a difference in the world. Cooperativism is supported by the transformation of society and the sustainable development, therefore, this is one of our biggest commitments to our associates and communities. In 2021, despite the pandemic, it was possible to develop several actions with the aim of promoting education, through our Programs. Get to know: RELATIONSHIP AND COOPERATIVISM involving children and young people, who later, at the end of the school year, will exhibit their ideas at a Job Fair at PUFV. Still within the PUFV, we carried out the “Investigative Expedition in the Cantelle Family Agribusiness”, where children can experience nature, preservation, as well as caring for life. Therefore, it is clear that the program provides a learning community that is part of the construction of stories of cooperation and citizenship. Training young people with communicative skills Investigative Expedition in Family Agroindustry Cantelle19RELATIONSHIPS AND COOPERATIVISM Literary Olympiad Coffee with the PresidentAs School Cooperatives are student associations with educational purposes. They function as a laboratory, in which, through a pedagogical proposal that encourages the practice of cooperation, students develop economic, social and cultural activities. Associated students meet after school and are accompanied by a teacher to hold meetings, workshops and plan actions. “United in the Sementes School Cooperative - South (Unicooperss)”, formed by students from the 5th to the 9th year of the Escola Municipal de Ensino Fundamental 11 de Abril, in Erebango/RS, is the first School Cooperative of Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG. Training young people with communicative skills is a permanent objective of society - so that the seeds of the habit of reading and writing correctly remain throughout their social and professional lives. In this sense, to contribute to this motivation, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG launched in 2021 a Literary Olympiad, whose theme was: “Financial Education in the Current Context”. More than 600 students and more than 30 teachers from public schools in the municipalities covered by the cooperative participated in this initiative, with an eye also on promoting writing skills based on good reading habits. In 2021, the “Coffee with the President” event allowed school students to visit the Administrative Headquarters of Sicre - di Sul Minas RS/MG, in which they shared a breakfast with the president of the cooperative and, later, they had a chat to clarify doubts. 20 8th Week of Financial Education (ENEF) One of the classes that participated in the program Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG believes that, through financial education, it is possible to transform the relationship with money and, thus, gain more independence and freedom. The “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis” program aims to help promote a sustainable financial life. A Movement in this program is carried out to provide new opportunities for the communities in which Si - credi is present and, therefore, boost the growth of members. All actions are designed to promote a more prosperous society. Crescer, Sicredi's cooperative education program, offers moments to spread knowledge about credit cooperatives. By understanding the importance of this business model and its role in society, the associate participates more actively in the cooperative, generating better results for everyone. Our financial education program The culture of credit cooperativesApproximately 450 children were impacted in 2021 with the actions of the “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis” program, among these actions, during the 8th Financial Education Week (ENEF), activities of integration and awareness with children and adolescents regarding the topic of financial education were developed, such as games, lectures, visits to agencies. Workshops also took place in schools in the municipalities covered by Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG, resulting in learning in a playful way, in which it was possible to learn how to use money more consciously. Therefore, it is a program committed to training collaborators, associates and cooperative leaders, aiming to qualify participation in the management and sustainable development of the cooperative, providing opportunities for associate understand what our differentiators are. 21 Food donation Believing in member development, the “O entrepreneur” program is aimed at legal entities, individuals and agribusiness. The initiative has a partnership with Sebrae and aims to contribute to people's growth. In four years of action in Rio Grande do Sul, several benefits were offered to those who already undertake or want to start undertaking, and in 2021 the implementation of the project also in the state of Minas Gerais. Every year, in the month of July, we celebrate C Day (Cooperate Day), a national initiative organized by the OCB System (Organization of Brazilian Cooperatives) that seeks to demonstrate the strength of cooperativism in favor of social transformations. On that day, participating organizations carry out social responsibility actions in the communities, aligned with the principles of cooperativism, through volunteering actions. In this sense, with the aim of promoting social responsibility and bringing development to communities, a mobilization was carried out to collect non-perishable food, which resulted in approximately 5.5 tons of donations. The proceeds were allocated to social entities and families in situations of social vulnerability in the municipalities where Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG operates. Furthermore, other initiatives were carried out during 2021, such as such as: mobilizations for employees to donate blood and donations of toys and kits with basic hygiene items on celebratory dates, such as Christmas. Lecture “Consumer behavior: how to keep up with the speed of change?” 22 The Assemblies are the maximum moment of participation, in which associates take the lead and participate in decisions that affect the direction of the business. In them, the main themes are debated and deliberated, chosen representatives, approved the rendering of accounts and decided the distribution of results, among other issues. Decisions are taken by their core coordinators to the Ordinary General Assembly (AGO). At each meeting, participants received information about the cooperative's numbers and expressed their position through voting, thus exercising the second principle of cooperativism: democratic management. Seeking to promote transparency for associates and communities, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG held its 2021 Core Meeting online in August. The moment provided an opportunity to learn about the results achieved during the first half of this year, as well as explaining the main actions carried out by the cooperative. On April 26th, we promoted the 2021 As - assemblies virtually, with the participation of 2,612 members. The moment, held online, provided the opportunity for members and the community in general to know the results achieved by the cooperative and the main actions carried out in 2020, in addition to defining the future of Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG. Assemblies Meeting of Centers Meeting of Centers 2021, online23NPS The purpose of making the world prosper is intrinsic in Sicredi's daily actions, especially those related to member service, in all the channels they choose to interact with. Focused on providing differentiated service through Due to its close relationship, Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG has gained recognition in this regard. In December 2021, the satisfaction index among the cooperative's members reached 78.3%, a result 5 percentage points higher than that recorded in January of the previous year. In addition to being the best index ever achieved by the cooperative, the metric achieved consolidates its status in the “Zone of Excellence” in relation to services, products and services. “In addition to recognizing and prove our quality, the result obtained in the NPS demonstrates the importance of basing purpose and value in our activities. We are guided by respect and efficiency, which are fundamental in relationships with associates. The numbers show that we are on the right path”, declared the cooperative's Executive Director, Roberto Luis Frumi. To measure the level of satisfaction of its members, the institution uses the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology, created by Bain & Company and applied by companies around the world. NPS (Net Promoter Score) is a metric used to measure the level of customer satisfaction (in our case, associates). This research methodology is applied worldwide by several companies. To obtain the indicator, a monthly telephone survey is carried out, with some randomly selected members, in which they are asked: “Considering a score from 0 to 10, what is the probability of you recommending the cooperative to a friend?” If If the member says 0 to 6, he is considered a detractor, that is, he is dissatisfied. From 7 to 8, he is a neutral associate. From 9 to 10, he is a promoter, which means he is very satisfied with the cooperative's services and support. The calculation is made by the percentage of promoters minus detractors. The result can be from -100 to 100. In this account, values ​​from 75 onwards are considered levels of excellence.Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG achieves satisfaction index record with its members Cooperative achieved a score of 78.3% in the NPS, a metric used to calculate member satisfaction with customer service, products and services.
