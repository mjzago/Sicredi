Close relationships are essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, even more so in a period of economic recovery, offering financial solutions for micro and small businesses, small rural producers, professionals associated autonomous edema. We did all this without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it further increased the prices of several commodities, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. Vaccination success allowed the country to go through the wave of the Ômicron variant, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and in the Federal District, completing its national expansion. The growth of the physical service network is aligned with the objectives of being close to meeting the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of associates and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new members. Institutional Highlight With roots in the countryside, and a long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 2nd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness.
