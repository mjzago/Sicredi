Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Code of Professional Ethics of the Accountant and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Cooperative's Report administration. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to the its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing statements financial Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. To the Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Additionally:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the continuity capacity operation of the Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the statements financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, March 10, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, resources collected are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts:Administration Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, with the founding of the first cooperative credit, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its cycle of interest rate hike in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a trend disinflationary. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy s and become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October. On the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. The numbers achieved by Sicredi Sul Minas RS/MG demonstrate the Cooperative's commitment to the economic development of the region, in light of this, we made more than R$ 1.3 billion available in operations credit. This amount includes important projects, such as For example, <Mulheres Empreendedoras= which received R$ 1.7 million in credit, Pronampe received R$ 2.2 million and, in addition, we allocated R$ 2.3 million to the Juro Zero RS incentive program, in addition to other fronts . Furthermore, we reached the mark of R$797 million in deposits. Through the fundraising campaign <Movimentação doBem=, we contributed financially to more than 100 entities, transferring more than R$400,000 in donations. We earned more than R$2 million with new insurance (life and elementary) in 2022, and we increased more than R$26 million in new consortia. We expanded our operations with the opening of two new branches in Minhas Gerais and improved our services by reopening three branches, two in Rio Grande do Sul and one in Minas Gerais. The expansion process allowed our growth, there were 6,360 new members in 2022. We also held the second edition of Agroshow, a regional event that aims to promote agribusiness and local businesses. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: We were present in the community with the aim of strengthening social development and the local economy, in this sense, we sponsored dozens of municipal events. We continue to develop the <AUnião Faz a Vida= program in all municipalities in our area of ​​operation in Rio Grande de Sul and in the municipalities of Pimenta and Santo Antônio do Monte in Minas Gerais, impacting more than 3,000 students and 450 teachers. Through the "School Cooperatives" program, we maintained the initiatives of Unicoopers, in Erebango/RS, and founded the second cooperative <Cooper Ação Ipi=, in Ipiranga do Sul/RS. We develop lectures on financial education in schools and companies, through the "Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis" program. On another front, we trained the cooperative’s leaders, within the "Grow" program, with the aim of preparing them for the future. In partnership with Sebrae, we developed the <OEmpreendedor= program, seeking to stimulate the development of people and companies looking to start a company or further develop their business. On "Cooperate Day (Day C)" we collected almost 3 tons of food that were donated to people in socially vulnerable situations. We promoted the 2022 Assemblies virtually, with the participation of approximately 2,000 members. Through the Social Fund, we invested over R$500,000 in our region of operation, contributing to several areas, including public safety and health. In addition to several other initiatives. Recognitions For over 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Revista Você S/A, Central Bank and BNDES rankings. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in terms of physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.
