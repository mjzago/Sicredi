NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTSAr) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of its determination. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constituting a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the delay periods and the group economic, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by the Administration, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of disbursements of the entity for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the loss test due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits;q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for registration, measurement and disclosure contingent assets and liabilities, as well as legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, finalized in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient security. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. They are demonstrated by known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro rata-die basis incurred, deducted of the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 15%. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation basis for years previous ones, this deduction being limited to 30% of taxable profit. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation , such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). In the municipal sphere, the cooperative is subject the incidence of the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated based on revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. Income arising from operations carried out with members is tax-free.o) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) This document was digitally signed by Jandira Kuhn Esteves, Eduardo Netto Sarubbi and Carlos Paes Machado.

Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of operations, the complexity of products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support System institutions in capital management. The processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: • Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by legal minimum capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above the minimum legal requirements and that reflect the risk appetite of the system, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and guarantee business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on the adequacy of capital for the board of directors and the board of directors; The guarantees provided include operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to associates via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor under a contract signed between the parties . The amounts are mostly made up of Finame and BNDES programs.

IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the scale of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing IRRBB risk. To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation result (NII) approaches are used. The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for Sicredi System's IRRBB risk management includes: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the dimension of exposure to the IRRBB risk of the System's institutions. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in the market values ​​of deposits held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices.
