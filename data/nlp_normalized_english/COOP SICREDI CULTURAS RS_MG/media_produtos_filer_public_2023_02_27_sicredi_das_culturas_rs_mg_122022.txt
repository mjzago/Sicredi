In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective flows cash flow for the year ending on that date, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BAC EN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the report of the auditor The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is, materially, inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BAC EN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessment of the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those with responsibility for supervision the process of preparing financial statements s. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit performed In accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, it always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international standards of audit, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting distortion material resulting from fraud is greater than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the continuity capacity operation of the Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, February 13, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative Regions of Cultures - Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Sicredi Confederation Accounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Controllership SuperintendenceFinancial Statements 2022 We are an institution cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating the generation income and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperation, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fedfunds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and must continue at this high level until half of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good growth of GDP in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement of the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching a record decline and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, as the increase in credit and the escalation of prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society The Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG cooperative celebrated an important milestone in 2022, reaching 70 thousand members, who seek solutions for their financial lives in the cooperative. The expansion of business to Minas Gerais is one of the aspects that supported this growth and in the last year, two more agencies started their activities in the state of Minas Gerais, in the municipalities of Itamogi and Nova Resende, adding to five others agencies in the region and 17 operating in Rio Grande do Sul. Currently, Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG has 24 branches, located in 20 municipalities within its area of ​​action. Last year was also marked by the launch of the “Invista no Bem” action, an initiative that contributes financially to non-profit entities associated with the cooperative. All members can participate, nominating an entity to benefit after the application of resources. Sicredi donates a percentage of the value (according to regulation), without impacting the income from the investment made. From the action, directly aligned with the institution's purpose of building more prosperous societies, it was possible to benefit more than 300 entities, which carry out different work in support of society. In 2022, the cooperative reinforced its credit offer focused on solar energy, holding fairs with different conditions, which also included offering solutions aimed at vehicle financing. At end during the exercise, it also joined the systemic consortium campaign, with special conditions, which made it possible to strengthen the offer of this product to members. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: Last year, we reaffirmed our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with emphasis on for objective 2, relating to the fight against hunger. Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG encouraged its teams to voluntarily carry out food collection activities in the communities in which it operates. From this initiative, it was possible to collect around 7 tons of non-perishable food throughout the year, which were later donated to charitable institutions. Furthermore, the cooperative sought throughout the year to strengthen the performance of its Sustainability Committee, holding recurring meetings and encouraging the use of the “Sustainable Development Benchmark” tool, which supports Sicredi to have institutional guidance, helping cooperatives to be even more protagonists of local development. In its 6th edition, the Empreender para Transformar (PET) Program was also highlighted in 2022. Based on this initiative, Sicredi das Culturas supports sustainable, sporting, cultural and educational projects developed by non-profit entities in its area of ​​activity. This year, the program included 233 entities that carry out projects and social actions in the cooperative's area of ​​action. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Revista Exame, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Revista Você S/A, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the highest rating agency, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil for physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will follow building a more prosperous society.
