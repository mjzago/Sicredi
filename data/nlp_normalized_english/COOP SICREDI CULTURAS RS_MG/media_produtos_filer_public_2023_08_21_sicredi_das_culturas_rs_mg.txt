The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account The probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits;q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measurement and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, passed in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; • Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. They are demonstrated by known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 15%. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and calculation basis negative CSLL from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of taxable profit. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned from operations with non-members, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation , such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). In the municipal sphere, The cooperative is subject to the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated based on revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. Income arising from operations carried out with members is tax-free.o) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current)Total no current 605,813 545,741 1,602,319 Total current 1,086,544 1,056,578 Total portfolio 22,007 391,907 672,630 605,813 1,692,357 Total other credits 981 67,755 24,410 362 93,508 82,666 317 Amounts receivable relating to payment transactions (Note 08) - 67,724 24,279 117 92,120 82,077 Debtors for the purchase of values ​​and goods (Note 08) - 24 131 245 400 1,519,653 Guarantees and guarantees honored (Note 08) 981 7 - - 988 272 Total credit operations 21,026 324,152 648,220 605.451                               1.598.849                     599.209  Financiamentos habitacionais                         -                                   8                                  24                                      479                                           511                                  - Financiamentos rurais e agroindustriais                1.415                      181.538                       335.436                                63.338 581,727 779,221 Financing 521 13,073 36,675 96,469 146,738 141,223 Total portfolioUp to 3 months 3 to 12 months Over 12 months Loans and discounted securities 19,090 129,533 276,085 445,165 8 69,873 NOTE 07 – CREDIT OPERATIONS a) Composition of credit operations by type of operation and deadlines Credit operations and Other credits 06/30/2023 12/31/2022 Due from 15 daysTo be due Total portfolioTotal 56,279 54,622 Cooperativa Central Sicredi Sul /Southeast 32.533                                                                                   30.876 Sicredi Participações S.A.                                                                                 23.742                                                                                   23.742  Sicredi Fundos Garantidores                                                                                           4 4 The market value of federal public securities, part of the investment fund portfolio, was determined based on the quotation obtained from ANBIMA. a) Cooperative shares Registered at acquisition cost 06/30/2023 12/31/2022As of July 2022, BACEN established, through BCB Normative Instruction No. 268 of April 1, 2022, that cooperative shares, previously presented under the heading of other investments, are now classified into securities and values furniture.

III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue to delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the business continuity strategies adopted are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard provide for the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure an adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of entities.For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital held by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through of a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. The processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution of the System.
