Sicredi, as a cooperative financial institution, is committed to the growth of its members and the development of the regions where it operates. We remain firm in our commitment to contributing to the economic activity of communities, considering their different realities and needs, constantly seeking to create opportunities for connection between associates and the latest technological trends, stimulating income generation and local economic and social development, with the purpose of having a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable society every day. Close relationships are essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, even more so in a period of economic recovery, offering financial solutions for micro and small businesses, small rural producers, self-employed professionals and other associates. We did it all without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it raised prices even further. of various commodities, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to overcome the wave of the variant Ômicron, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion. Network growth Physical service is aligned with the objectives of being close to meeting the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of associates and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new cooperators. Institutional Highlight With roots in the countryside, and a long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 2nd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness. Also, this semester, we ranked 4th among the best financial institutions in Brazil in the World’s Best Banks 2022 ranking, carried out by Forbes in partnership with Statista. Our members rely on a solid cooperative financial institution rated by the main risk rating agencies in the world, having an AA(bra) rating from Fitch and a “Strong” rating for its Asset, also granted by the agency. It is also rated by Moody's (Aa2) and Standart & Poor's (AAA). Programs and Initiatives Our commitment to the regions where we are present goes beyond financial services, including encouraging general and financial education through programs and initiatives, diversity, youth protagonism, among other topics. The first half of 2022 was marked by important economic and social results for Sicredi dasCulturas RS/MG. The cooperative financial institution completed 97 years of history and cooperation in communities, delivering its mission to its members by making dreams come true, by assisting in the maintenance and development of companies, as well as by contributing to the aggregation of income on rural properties. This was possible through several actions and activities that strengthen Sicredi's operating model, based on cooperation. Among them, emphasis is placed on offering responsible solutions, adapted to the moment in time for each public, with fair differentiated rates. Promoting access to credit in an easy and agile manner, as well as providing varied credit lines to develop rural production and the business sector, are also among the main initiatives. In the first half of 2022, the cooperative further reinforced its performance in offering a specific credit line for financing of implementation projects for solar energy systems, with attractive rates for both the Individual and Legal Entity segments. As one of the main financiers of the agricultural sector, it played an important role in providing new technologies, equipment, structures and inputs for farmers, through the offer of rural credit. In addition to the economic pillar, our cooperative also carries out sustainable actions through social programs that promote the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship. Among them is the Empreender para Transformar Program (PET), which each year makes it possible to carry out projects developed by non-profit institutions, focused on sustainability, culture, sport and education. Another great example of the mobilization of the cooperative was the Invest no Bem Action, in which members are invited to make investments with Sicredi and the cooperative donates an amount equivalent to a percentage of the investment made to the non-profit entity indicated by the associated, at no cost to this member. Activities aimed at Financial Education also continue to be promoted, through the national program “Cooperation at Ponta doLápis”, an initiative that seeks to bring knowledge and information on the subject to the regions in which the cooperative operates, directly supporting members and local communities. Collaborating with development and generating a positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Our main social programs are focused especially on cooperation, education and local development. Acknowledgments Even in a scenario of uncertainty due to the global economic crisis, we remain present and active in economic and social contributions to the communities where we operate. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.

This, had 0.50% of minimum provision for possible losses, being increased to 0.99%, that is, an increase of 0.49% in the provision in said rating. In November/2021, the Cooperative made provision additional through the increase in the percentage of provision for rating B. This, had a 1% minimum provision for possible losses, being increased to 1.50%, that is, an increase of 0.50% of provision in the aforementioned rating. It should be noted that the additional provisions defined are validated and approved through Minutes of the Administrative Council No. 22/2021, and the main causes of these conservative movements that aim to protect the Cooperative against possible increases in default that has been demonstrated as a market trend at the SFN level.” As provided in Art. 5th of BACEN Resolution No. 4,800/20, the provision in the face of losses for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must only apply to the amount equivalent to the Equity allocated for this purpose, these values ​​are being presented together with the amount provisioned for credit operations and other credits.

The provisions arising from these contracts comprise the amount of R$ 5,812 (December 2021 - R$ 5,183) as per Note 14. As approved by the Board of Directors Executive, drawn up in date no. 07/2021, the Cooperative had additional provisioning rating C, amounting to 4%, with this percentage being applicable until July/2021.
