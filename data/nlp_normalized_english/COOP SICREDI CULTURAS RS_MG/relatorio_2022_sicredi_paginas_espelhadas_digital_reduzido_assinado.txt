PREFACE6 7 Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG - 2022Message from the PresidentMessage from the Executive Director In 2022 we celebrate 120 years of cooperation credit in Brazil. For us at Sicredi, it is a very important milestone. special, because we are pioneers of this history. It was in 1902 that the first credit cooperative in Latin America was created, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, on the initiative of Father Theodor Amstad, who joined together with 20 local associates and, together, put into practice this collective vision for the construction of a better future. This is how Sicredi was born. We are very proud of our history, but, beyond celebrating our origins, we care about the present and the legacy we are leaving it to the next generations, seeking to keep the flame of cooperativism alive. For our part, Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG, one of the 100 cooperatives that make up the Sicredi System, expands its activities in Minas Gerais. In the southwest of Minas Gerais, we opened two more branches in 2022 and continue working to bring our financial solutions and prosperity to more and more municipalities in Minas Gerais. In Rio Grande do Sul, we continue to strengthen the virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Thus, we continue to take new steps and generate a positive impact on society, through the essence of cooperativism. Antenor José Vione President of Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG.Roque Enderle Executive Director of Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG.In our reports we present increasingly high numbers expressive, resulting from our actions, which promote the exponential growth that we have experienced in recent years. In 2022, we celebrated the acquisition of more than 71 thousand members in our cooperative and our managed assets exceeded R$4 billion. However, although the numbers support our operations and are fundamental for maintaining the structure of our cooperative, it is our commitment to the quality of the financial lives of our members and to the prosperity of the communities in which we are inserted, which move us. What goes beyond the numbers is recorded especially in the reports of our associates, which we will share on the following pages. We help make dreams come true, support the growth of companies and encourage agribusiness, which is so fundamental to the constant development of our regions. In 2022 we launched the Invista no Bem solidarity action, of which we are very proud. From this initiative we gave another great step towards building more prosperous societies. The member invests and makes gains in their financial life, based on their investments, and can still do good, nominating a non-profit entity to receive resources from Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG. This way we also benefit the community, which is assisted by the institutions participating in this solidarity action. I invite you to learn about some of the projects developed using these resources in our report. These and other stories that we have experienced throughout the year give us the certainty that we are on the right path. Looking back and realizing everything we mobilized in 365 days leaves us with a feeling of gratitude and motivated to move forward, building an increasingly fair, sustainable and cooperative society.

Life insurance and private pension are examples of investments to guarantee quality of life in the long term. This was the theme of a lecture promoted in partnership between Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG and Icatu Seguros during Expofest. The event took place at Casa do Produtor, at the Exhibition Park in Ijuí/RS. The topic was addressed by César Saut, vice pre - corporate side of Icatu Seguros. “Icatu and Sicredi have a 25-year relationship. I am very proud to say that we have more than two million active life insurance operations and this means that part of Sicredi's members in the region and, of the entire population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, are protected with regard to life insurance, as a result of the joint work we do to raise awareness, in a general and broad way, among the population about Throughout 2022, we interacted with the community in Minas Gerais, participating, in a special way, in five stages of the Circuito Mineiro da Queima do Alho, held in Itamogi, Santa Cruz da Prata (Pratinha, in Guaranésia), São Sebastião do Paraíso, Monte Santo de Minas and Passos. Curiosity: The so-called Queima do Alho is a traditional festivity in the cooperative’s area of ​​operation in the state of Minas Gerais and the name comes from the traditional culinary tradition of the entourages of cattle ranchers who traveled on horseback, days and days driving cattle from one place to another in various regions of Brazil. During this period, non-perishable food was carried on the back of donkeys and mules. There were stops to prepare lunch for the pedestrians and due to the use of garlic to prevent food from spoiling, and the smell that could be smelled from afar, this moment was called Queima do Alho. It is precisely this moment of food preparation that is portrayed at the party, in which each party prepares a dish typical for being ser - vido. In addition to typical cuisine, the event also features musical performances and has a solidarity bias, in which fundraising or supplies are donated to community charities. The “Entourages” of the Sicredi teams interacted at the party with the distribution and raffle of gifts and sweets.

Another point discussed was the issue of increasingly high life expectancy and the importance of preparing for a comfortable future after retirement, through private pensions. Saut also took advantage of his visit to Ijuí/RS to visit Expofest. “The party is a spectacle, Ijuí is to be congratulated, it is effectively a meeting point not only for ethnic groups, but also for Rio Grande do Sul and Brazil. The community in general is to be congratulated on what they are accomplishing,” praised.36 INTEGRATION WITH THE COMMUNITYCooperative celebrates agency anniversaries and three years of operation in Minas Gerais In 2022 we celebrate the first year of operation of the agencies in Passos/MG and Monte Santo de Minas/MG, celebrated in the months of April and December, respectively .

I studied in Santa Maria/RS until 2018 and when I returned to Panambi/RS, based on this interest that arose with my family, I looked for Sicredi to join. When I came here, one of the things that caught my attention the most was the organization of the city ​​as a whole and see Sicredi's presence in local actions. I see a force that has been operating in Panambi/RS for over 91 years, so the cooperative’s representation is huge in the community. Mathias Melchior Associate 70 thousand at Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG. This win-win relationship makes a lot of sense for people looking for cooperation.

For people who dream of purchasing something, the most viable alternative is through Sicredi, especially because I only work with Sicredi. You pay the installments and you can be drawn or, if you want, you can place a bid. The installments are low and I know that the credit is there for when I want to start building.

Therefore, we created the Business Partners Program, to offer the best payment solutions to customers of partner companies, also enabling an increase in revenue. This solution made it possible to offer and contract credit at the moment of sales, without having to go to one of our agencies. This made it much easier to close the sale instantly. Partner companies benefit from more cash flow, easier sales and autonomy. Customers can take out credit from Sicredi more easily and quickly. The idea for this Program came to Cotripal, which has been a partner of Sicredi for many years, and we soon decided to join. With this, our customers and associates can have more agile and faster credit. We, as suppliers of machines, equipment, construction materials, among others, can make this sale, which was made easier, and deliver more satisfaction in service. This is part of our purpose: to serve our associate or customer not only with a good product, but also by delivering this solution at the time of purchase. Here we are concerned on a daily basis with having the merchandise, providing good service, having stock and making delivery, which represents a whole logistical work. We add to this this financial partnership that facilitates sales. We already had a credit offer with shorter terms, now we have the possibility of going further and this was a gain we had, the difference of having this special offer. This union between cooperatives, with this partnership, helps us to grow and we will certainly reap more fruits in the future.

In the beginning it is Everything is very new for those who are starting a business, many doubts arise, so having this support from Sicredi and its entire team is very good. In my physical account I also have this close service and I even managed to get Leonardo da Silva Neto Associate from the Ijuí Centro/RS agency to make some dreams come true, like buying a property on the beach. I use the ticket tag as a convenience when I travel by car and I also took trips abroad and was able to count on Sicredi's travel insurance.

The member, Alberto Klafke, has had an account with the cooperative since the founding of the agency in Santo Augusto, in 1989. Currently the family is among the four largest milk producers in the municipality, however, at the beginning of its activities, in 1977, it only had with three cows and five heifers, it produced 20 liters of milk at the time per day. Over the years, his herd and production increased and, now, milk is the family's main source of income. Mr. Alberto retired and the production activity was passed on to his sons: Paulo, Julio and Eugenio. With the growth of the activity, and in the search for a better quality of life, the brothers, after much guidance, technical support and financial consultancy from the cooperative, decided to invest in the modernization and improvements of the property by building a compost. In addition, machines and equipment were acquired to speed up the process and increase productivity. The investment aims to house around 200 animals, which according to studies carried out, yield an annual increase, per animal, of 3,650 liters of milk. Long partnership, constant growth Associates increase productivity in one year, with support from SicrediIn 2021 we looked for Sicredi, exchanged ideas and, based on these conversations, we built a large, modern space, which made our work much easier and contributed to increased productivity. Thanks to this partnership with Sicredi, a cooperative of which we have been partners since its founding in 1989 Santo Augusto/RS, we were able to build this work with more than 6,000 m², which has capacity for 240 animals, with a milking room, fans, feeding lanes, automated cleaning, as well as coolers. We also finance solar energy with Sicredi to save energy and, to have more peace of mind, we took out insurance for this new space on our property. We are from the interior of Ijuí/RS, but we went to Ajuricaba/RS to work at the milk drum and we had the idea of ​​starting our own business. It was very simple, at the beginning there was no greenhouse, there was nothing, it was a cucumber plantation and we had the idea of ​​building the first greenhouse. We then began to diversify our cultivation and learned day by day. The first year we planted tomatoes and lettuce and it worked well. So in Second year we started planting strawberries and that's how we grew. Sicredi made a large part of our dream come true. The cooperative helped us increase the greenhouses for the tomato plantation, we started with one, then increased it to ten more, it also helped us with costs and brought ideas to make our work easier, such as automatic irrigation. The investment is expensive and we need someone who believes with us and Sicredi believed in our dream. Marlen Freitas Steurer Rural producer, associate of the Ajuricaba/RS agency. Paulo Klafke Rural producer, associate of the agency Santo Augusto/RS.74 75 Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG - 2022PROSPERITY BUSINESSESInvestment to speed up production Mechanization of production generates well-being and increases coffee qualityMy relationship with Sicredi is old, at least least 30 years. The cooperative has already contributed a lot to my property during this period, I bought several machines, trucks, sprayers, driver, automotive, implements. Furthermore, every year I pay my expenses with Sicredi. My last acquisition was a harvester, I acquired Luiz Claudio Coppetti Associate from the Ijuí São Francisco/RS agency. equipment to add technology and agility to my property, because when the harvest is ready, we need a good machine to carry out the work. I recommend everyone to join, the service is always very good. Who arrives at the members’ property Pedro Antonio de Souza and Andrea Aparecida Vieira de Souza, in Passos/MG, can already see the couple's gratitude towards the Sicredi team and the close relationship they have with the cooperative. After drinking traditional coffee, produced on the property itself, the associates take the team to show the structure, built with the support of Sicredi das Culturas RS/MG. The relationship with the cooperative financial institution began with a visit in which the service team listened to the needs of the couple, who at that moment needed a shed and a coffee dryer. “Until then, no one had proposed this opportunity to us, to help us carry out this construction, which was our dream. And Sicredi gave us this dream”, highlights Andrea. Before the structure, production on the property was manual, as the coffee was dried in an open-air yard, also called natural drying. The acquisition of machinery directly influences quality of life and family well-being, as well as the quality of the coffee produced. Remembering that drying is one of the product processing processes and carrying it out mechanized also helps to contain labor costs, practicality in the drying process, harvest planning and production optimization. Sicredi came to help rural producers a lot, I think they needed a cooperative to encourage producers in this part of structure, construction, because there are a lot of producers who want to do something, but can't do it. You need encouragement and someone to encourage you. It's like a child, if you don't encourage him to take the first step, he won't walk. Sicredi is like that, he says ‘come on, you can do it, let’s build the structure, let’s build the shed, let’s put the machine inside’. Antonio de Souza and Andrea Aparecida Vieira de Souza Associates at the Passos/MG agency. Check out the testimony of video associates. Pedro and Andrea de Souza, associates of the Passos/MG agency, invested to ensure more practicality in production.

From the historical date of November 1, 2013, the hitherto isolated trajectory of the cooperatives Sicredi Ajuricaba/RS, Augusto Pestana/RS, Panambi/RS and Santo Augusto/RS began to converge with the creation of a new unified cooperative , stronger and better structured. From this union of four cultures different, the inspiration for the name of the cooperative emerged, which in 2018, with the approval of expanding our area of ​​action to Minas Gerais, added another culture: Minas Gerais. Furthermore, the use of the term “Cultures” is also related to the cooperative’s headquarters city. Ijuí, in Rio Grande do Sul, is recognized as “Land of Diversified Cultures”, given its historical formation, made up of varied ethnic groups. Cafézinho x Chimarrão Both are drinks typical in each state. It can be said that coffee is recognized nationally (and even worldwide), but did you know that the state of Minas Gerais is the largest coffee producer in Brazil? Chimarrão is the symbolic drink of the Gauchos and the tradition of drinking a “bitter mate” is passed down from generation to generation within families.
