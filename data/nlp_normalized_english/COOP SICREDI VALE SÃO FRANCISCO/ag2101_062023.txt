Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, after which they are written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in memorandum accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. g) Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk The provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of operations and takes into account the economic situation, past experience, the specific and global risks of the portfolios, considering the provisioning criteria, defined in C MN Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00, associated with the assessments carried out by Management, in determining credit risks. q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, as well as legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely : •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Liabilities contingents are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. They are demonstrated by the values known or calculable, including, when applicable, the charges and monetary variations on a pro-rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 15%. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation base adjustments provided for in the legislation and the offset of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation base from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of the taxable profit. Still at the federal level, cooperatives are subject to contributions to the Social Integration Program (PIS –0.65%) and Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS –4%) on revenues earned in operations with no associated, after deducting specific items provided for by legislation, such as surpluses determined in the Statements of Surplus or Losses (DSP). At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated from revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality. The tickets arising from operations carried out with members are not subject to taxes. Term deposits are made up of amounts agreed to be available within pre-established terms, which are updated by remunerative financial charges according to their post-fixed contract and are stated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. Interbank deposits are made up of resources received on deposit from other market institutions, in accordance with current regulations specific to interbank deposit operations, observing that the institution must maintain internal controls for the purpose of funding limits. Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions for the purpose of financing operations. o) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) m) Reduction in the recoverable value of assets Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable value is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized at the amount at which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset. n) Deposits, loan obligations and transfers They are stated at the amounts of liabilities, considering charges, exchange rate and monetary variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of of values ​​whose availability is immediate to members, therefore without a deadline determined to move them, with the holder of the resources at the discretion of doing so according to their needs. Savings deposits are made up of amounts whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the holder of the resources to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. The resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Centralization financial 135,420 102,693 When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 06/30/2023 12/31/2022 Cash and cash equivalents 1,880 3,476 s) Functional currency The financial statements are expressed in reais (R$), which is the functional currency of the Cooperative, unless otherwise indicated, in thousands of reais (R$ thousand). t) Recurring and non-recurring results Recurring results are those that are related to the characteristic activities of the Cooperative that occur frequently in the present and are expected to occur in the future, while non-recurring results are those that arise from a extraordinary and/or unpredictable event, with a tendency not to be repeated in the future. NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realizable or recoverable value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delay in payment of the principal portion or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the risk level, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor demands, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of assets intangibles and other assets: the loss test due to impairment of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; Total Total NOTE 05 - INTERFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY APPLICATIONS Description 06/30/2023 12/31/2022 Due Up to 3 months 3 to 12 months Over 12 months Total 137,300 106,169 Cash and cash equivalents are classified as cash and cash equivalents cash for the purpose of presenting the Statement of C Flows aixa, when complied with the provisions of CPC 03 (R2) – Cash Flow Statement.
