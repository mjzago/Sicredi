In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito do Vale do São Francisco - Sicredi Vale do São Francisco as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with current practices accounting rules adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with ethical principles relevant provisions set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises o Management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise form, appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.2 Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the statements financial institutions, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We got understanding the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.3  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance respect, among other aspects, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, March 24, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 ADMINISTRATION REPORT In this document, the administration of the Cooperative deCrédito do Vale doSão Francisco -Sicredi Vale doSãoFrancisco, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through the credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic In our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which has made it possible to expand the range of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need given to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During the 2021 fiscal year, the cooperative promoted numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of community where it operates, in addition to various social actions. We can highlight the following social businesses: - Continued action of the Camerata Sicredi Vale do São Francisco Project: promotes the teaching of music through string instruments, whose purpose is to resocialize young people and teenagers served by Funase Case Petrolina. Created in 2015, the project began activities on February 4, 2016. - Continued action in the Escola em Tempo Integral program: partnership started in 2019 until July/2021 with the Institute of Co-responsibility for Education (ICE) and Petrolina City Hall. With the aim of promoting transformation in the lives of children in elementary school I and II, in the city of Petrolina, we support the implementation of a differentiated full-time teaching methodology, giving the student a leading role in the school schedule. - Continued action Day of Cooperation: we mobilize donations of basic food baskets for the community hosted by the Diocese of Petrolina. Also An action was carried out in support of the celebration of street children's day, in the João de Deus neighborhood, Petrolina. - Christmas + solidarity action: donation of basic food baskets to children at the Casa Sementes do Ajante Institution, in Petrolina. - Continued action of the Aconchego Project: donations of diapers, hygiene materials, cleaning and meeting other demands needed to maintain the institution that welcomes the elderly. - Continued action SOS Animal: donations of food and cleaning material, to entities that rescue and shelter stray animals. - Continued action of monthly donations to the institutions Comunidade Terapêutica Ágape and Associação Petrolinense de Amparo à Maternidade e a Infância (APAMI). - Action to donate a hospital bed to Dom Tomás Hospital, which serves cancer patients. During this period we can highlight the following administrative facts: adaptation to the Sicredi governance model, with two directors, adjusting their respective duties; the realization of the Extraordinary General Assembly on 12/01/2021 for the broad reform of the Cooperative's Bylaws to adapt it to the Sicredi system statute; and the creation of the New Social Fund, aimed at meeting social actions of collective interest.

Sicredi Vale doSão Francisco ("Cooperative"), is a financial institution cooperative, affiliated to the Central Credit Cooperative of the North/Northeast -Central Sicredi Norte/Nordeste ("Central") and member of the Sicredi Cooperative System ("Sicredi"). The Cooperative is a non-banking financial institution, authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil ("Bacen") with its activities beginning on 12/20/2000 and its headquarters located at RPresidente Dutra, 61, in the city of Petrolina - Pernambuco. The Cooperative's main objectives are: i) Develop programs savings, adequate use of credit and service provision, carrying out all active, passive and ancillary operations typical of credit cooperatives; ii) Provide, through mutuality, financial assistance to members in their specific activities; iii) Work on the educational training of its members, with a view to promoting cooperativism. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF REAIS) The reclassified values ​​are shown in the tables below: STATEMENTS OF SURPOSES AND LOSSESPreviously PresentedReclassification Represented 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council -CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil -BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20 which regulated procedures for the preparation and disclosure of financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Plan were also observed Accounting for the Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33e46) and legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Law nº 4,595/64 enº5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from adjustments rectification of error in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows of intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as per previously adopted understanding, and should be considered as income and revenue from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Between changes regulations arising from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented.
