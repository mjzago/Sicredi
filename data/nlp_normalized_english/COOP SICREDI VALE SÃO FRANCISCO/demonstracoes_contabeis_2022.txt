Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlighted the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a posture of monetary tightening, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of reducing the global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a deinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest cycle with Selica 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society #Information Classification: Internal UseWe value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate, these are premises since our founding.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable realization or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delay in payment of installments of principal or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil and tax risks and labor: Based on loss forecasts assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the loss test due to reduction to the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of credit risk of assets, market risks and its financial instruments, production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyr) Main accounting judgments and estimates #Classification of information: Internal UseDescription During the year ended December 31, 2022, renegotiations of credit operations were carried out in the amount of R$6,429 (2021 - R$5,814).Recoveries of credits written off as losses 730                                                                                    1.054                                                                                        687  Total                                                              13.533                                                                                  25.622                                                                                   17.522 Subtotal 12.803                                                                                  24.568                                                                                   16.835 Empréstimos e títulos descontados                                                              10.363                                                                                  20.189                                                                                   14.522  Financiamentos 2,440 4,379 2,313 f) Result from credit operations: 2nd half of 2022 (Unaudited) 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Movement of write-offs (1,352) (2,063) (1.346) Saldo final                                                                 9.619                                                                                    9.619                                                                                     5.249 Constituição de provisão                                                                 5.452                                                                                  10.984 4,803 Provision reversal (2,823) (4,551) (2,435)2nd half of 2022 (Unaudited) 12/31/2022 12/31/2021 Opening balance 8,342 5,249 4,227 Total 140,734 100.00 125,465 100.00 e) Movement in the provision for expected losses associated with credit risk100 following debtors 23,057 16.38 21.537                          17,17  Demais                                      71.937                                              51,12                                              61.336                          48,89 10 maiores devedores                                      16.123                                              11,46                                              16.079                          12,81  50 devedores seguintes                                      29.617 21.04 26,513 21.13 d) Concentration of credit operations 12/31/2022 % 12/31/2021 %Total non-current 76,294 72,499 125,465 Total current 64,440 52,966 Total 2,826 23,367 38,247 76.29 4 140.734 Pessoas jurídicas                 913                        7.929                       14.844                              21.434                              45.120                        43.555                          2.403  Comércio                 747                        5.742                          9.557                              17.893                              33.939                        24.098 Industrial                    10                            256 734 928 1,928 59,747 55,409 Total Portfolio Total Portfolio Up to 3 months 3 to 12 months Over 12 months Individuals 1,156 9,440 13,112 36,039 The Cooperative also has guarantee obligations provided in the amount of R$10,347 (December 2021 - R$4,882) which includes operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to associated companies via Banco Cooperative Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and guarantees joint guarantees by virtue of a contract signed between the parties (Note 26).
