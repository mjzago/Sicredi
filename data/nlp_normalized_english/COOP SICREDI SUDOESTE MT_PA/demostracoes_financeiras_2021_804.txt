We continued to expand our offering of solutions through electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, app), which made many of our demands viable as these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive assistance. via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we returned to operating face-to-face in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DEMONSTRATIONS FINANCIAL (IN THOUSANDS OF REAIS) 264,259 10,400 274,659 Income Intercooperative Deposits - 10,400 10,400 The reclassified values ​​are shown in the tables below: STATEMENTS OF SURPLUS AND LOSSESPreviously PresentedReclassification Represented 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council -CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil -BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20 which regulated procedures for the preparation and disclosure of financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Plan were also observed Accounting for Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33e46) and legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Law nº 4,595/ 64 enº5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from adjustments rectification of error in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows of intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centers via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other income and operational revenues, as per previously adopted understanding, and should be considered as income and revenue from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centrals via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, a change occurred in the form of presentation of statements of surpluses or losses. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and equivalent of cash and securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of value, being possible classification as cash and cash equivalents in accordance with the premises of the CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the initial and final cash equivalent of the period ending December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of bonds and securities where they were previously presented.
