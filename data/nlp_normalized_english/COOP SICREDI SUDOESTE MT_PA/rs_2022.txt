After so many decades of incessant work, we continue to grow and prepare for the future, based on the cooperative ideals of our founders and generating value for our customers. members and their communities. With a sense of historical continuity, this report is an assessment of our trajectory and the main actions carried out in 2022. Aiming to always strengthen the principles of cooperativism, the year was marked by important changes in the management of the System, focused on our governance, continuing the excellent work of the teams and providing the best experience for our associates. Since March 2022, we have adopted the exclusive presidency of the Board of Directors. Still within the scope of the Council, we elected the Independent Director, Andiara Petterle, the first woman to occupy this position, reinforcing our commitment to expanding diversity in senior leadership positions. We also continued with the senior leadership succession plan, electing a new CEO of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi and Confederação Sicredi. From a regulatory point of view, we maintained our strong commitment to integrity and solidity in all our operations. Seeking to always be ahead of the best governance and management practices and aligned with regulatory movements in the financial sector, we updated the following internal policies: the Sustainability Policy and the Social, Environmental and Climate Risk Policy. We ended the year with an important milestone in our history: we registered the arrival of more than 1 million new members, who believe in our purpose and business model. That The achievement is the result of all the work carried out by our Cooperatives, Centrals and Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). 4INTRODUCTIONWe have consolidated ourselves as the second largest agribusiness financing institution, allocating R$53.8 billion in financing for the sector. We thus reinforce our commitment to the development of one of the most important economic activities for the country's growth and development.

We also continue to work towards the digital evolution of our business, in line with changes in society's behavior, trends in the global economy and especially the needs of our associates, adopting an approach that solidifies our strategy relationship for the future. We have significantly advanced our digital association journey, with the aim of bringing cooperativism to more people and delivering a simple and close experience to our members, in a way connected to local strategies. We highlight the launch of the Sicredi marketplace, developed to expand its presence in the life cycle and consumption of members, while strengthening the local economy. We also started offering access directly to the capital market with the launch of our variable income operation. Through it, members can trade shares, real estate funds, ETFs and BDRs on the spot market through Home Broker Sicredi, in addition to receiving digital service via WhatsApp. Just as we continually invest in expanding and qualifying the portfolio of digital solutions, we continue to expand the physical service network. With our arrival in the state of Roraima, in April, we provided the opportunity to dissemination of cooperative concepts to a new region and we began to operate in all federative units in Brazil. We currently have more than 2,400 branches in the country, with more than 270 being opened in 2022, representing an increase of 11.4% in our structure.

It has been a long and prosperous journey, which is closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. It was in 1902 that Father Theodor Amstad and leaders from the community of Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul, created Caixa de Economia e Empréstimos Amstad, currently Sicredi. Pioneer, marking the beginning of credit cooperatives in Brazil. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers . In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 people from the community, with whom he worked to put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. Together, they started a cooperative enterprise that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first central one, bringing together several cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. The model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining, over the decades, the objective of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits to associates, in the search for a better quality of life for all. 14THE SICREDI“Reaching the milestone of 120 years of credit cooperatives in Brazil fills us with pride, as it shows that we are consistently continuing the path that was opened by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen around 160 years ago, on the other side of the ocean, and followed in Brazil by Father Amstad.” Fernando Dall’Agnese, President of the Board of Directors of Sicredi (SicrediPar). "Ours principles and values ​​are based on cooperation between people, focusing on the development of regions through the promotion of a virtuous cycle, in which resources continue to circulate in the cooperative's area of ​​activity”. César Bochi, President Director of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of advance of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing quality food and essential items at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers got together and founded the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, ƎūƑ ŞĚĿū ēîɰČūūƎĚƑîďĈū Ě ƭŠĿĈū ēĚ ĚƙĲūƑďūƙɈ ƎƑūƎū ever ŕū fairer economic and social. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of cooperativism by understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved. 15 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 20221. Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people able to use their services and willing to accept responsibilities as members, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination. 2. Democratic management Cooperatives are organizations democratic, controlled by its members, who actively participate in the formulation of its policies and decision-making. Men and women, elected as representatives of the other members, are responsible to them. In first-degree cooperatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote); higher grade cooperatives are also organized democratically.3. Economic participation of members Contributions are made equitably for the capital of the cooperatives and control is carried out democratically. Part of this capital is normally common property of the cooperative (called the Reserve Fund). Members may receive, if there are economic and financial conditions to do so, a remuneration on the paid-in capital, called interest on share capital. Surpluses are destined for one or more of the following purposes: development of the cooperative, enabling the formation of reserves, partly indivisible; return to members in proportion to their transactions with cooperatives and support for other activities that are approved by members.4. Autonomy and independence Cooperatives are autonomous mutual aid organizations. Even when they enter into operational agreements with other entities, including government entities, they must do so in terms that preserve their democratic control by their partners and maintain their autonomy. cooperativism in practice The seven principles of cooperativism, which were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by the International Cooperative Alliance (ACI) in 1995. The principles of cooperativism direct and support us in generating positive impact: 16THE VIRTUOUS SICREDICYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities.5. Education, training and information Education, training and information of associates is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program, which develop cooperative citizens engaged in the development of their community.6. Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members and society. 7. Interest in the community Credit cooperatives may be located in regions with low levels of economic and social development, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. The perspective of the cooperative institution is not profit, but rather development. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth for the region. 17 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Expansion •In 2022, we continued our expansion process with the opening of another 270 branches, demonstrating accelerated growth in the post-pandemic economic recovery scenario. •We gained more than 1.2 million new members, 15% more compared to the previous year.Financial Education •The Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis was nominated and elected by popular vote as the best Financial Education Initiative in Brazil at the 2022 Banking Transformation Awards.

In addition to actively participating in discussions on the bill, we also anticipated the legal framework by putting into practice, at the beginning of the year, the reorganization of positions, being in compliance when the new regulations were published. Advisory committees The Board of Management of Sicredi Participações S.A. is advised by permanent committees, which have the function of analyzing certain matters in greater depth and making recommendations to the Board of Directors. GRI 2-9 | 2-12 Strategy Committee: Assists in structuring long-term strategies and in assessments regarding entry into new markets, strategic associations and eventual acquisitions, mergers and sales of System companies, as well as monitoring our strategic drivers.

It meets quarterly and reports to the Board of Directors on topics discussed at the meetings. People Committee: Supports decisions related to people management policies at a systemic level, as well as other strategic people management matters. The Committee meets on an ordinary basis four times a year and, on an extraordinary basis, whenever necessary and upon notice. 36GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGYGuarantee Funds Committee: Assists in decisions related to the use of resources from the Guarantee Funds intended for use corporate, encompassing recommendations for a technical feasibility study and economic-financial recovery, administrative procedures and sanctions in the event of non-compliance with the conditions for access to resources. The Committee meets whenever necessary, reporting to the Board of Directors on the topics discussed at the meetings. Risk and Compliance Committee: Supports the formulation, monitoring and control of the policies and methodology we employ related to risks (legal or internal) credit, market and liquidity, operational, environmental and others, in addition to the Risk Appetite Declaration, Compliance Policy and Compliance Program. It meets monthly and reports to the Board of Directors on the topics discussed at the meetings.

It meets every two months, reporting to the Board of Directors on the topics discussed at the meetings. 37 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Leadership remuneration Our remuneration policy aims to reward managers for actions that guarantee the sustainability of the business in the short, medium and long term. This internal rule takes into account consideration of the size of the entities and the composition of their assets. GRI 2-19 To determine the remuneration of leaders, we annually carry out a nationwide salary survey, together with an external consultancy, to maintain competitiveness in the entities' people management. GRI 2-20 Compensation consultants participate in the process by constructing salary reference tables considering the matching of positions with the salary survey. After these contributions, executive remunerations are approved at the General Meeting. GRI 2-20 We have a People Committee that monitors and participates in this decision-making for executives and other levels. For Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, we have a Remuneration Committee that monitors the strategic remuneration process. GRI 2-20 In addition to the fixed remuneration, there is a short-term annual variable portion, linked to the business performance in the period, and a variable portion long-term, aimed at retaining statutory employees, business sustainability, career transition and succession. The definition of goals and indicators for these variables is carried out by entity and, currently, no entity uses socio-environmental goals. GRI 2-19 Councilors of centrals and cooperatives receive attendance cards or a monthly fee approved at the General Assembly of members, also taking into account the size of each entity. Similar rules are used for companies based in the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS), approved by the General Assembly, observing the specific legislation of each company. GRI 2-19 The variable remuneration model for executives is based on calculations based on salary multiples defined by positions, short and long term, the latter in the Long Term Retention model (in a membership format per entity). We rely on the clawback rule for the variable remuneration model for CAS executives, which provides for a reduction in the amount to be paid in case specific requirements of the model are not met. GRI 2-19 We currently offer the Private Pension Plan for all employees and statutory employees. In this plan, the contribution can vary from 1% (one percent) to 10% (ten percent) of the monthly remuneration, according to the ceiling established by the entity. The amount is deducted from the payroll or monthly fees. In the same percentage chosen by the employee/statutory employee, there is counterpart from the company.

The manager of Structured Operations and Sustainable Finance, João Pedro Stephanou represented Sicredi in this year's edition. The opportunity to present a case at the world conference came at the invitation of Sebrae MT, which maintains a partnership with Central Sicredi Centro Norte. During the event, João Pedro presented the panel Green Energy Program – Opportunity for Small Businesses, where topics of cooperative model, governance model, sustainability strategy, ESG captures and good practices in clean energy were discussed, highlighting the photovoltaic solar energy financing. The economic benefits of credit unions and our entire sustainability movement were also presented. 51 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Sustainable Development Framework To guide our Sustainability Strategy and support us in the evolution of sustainability guidelines, we rely on the Sustainable Development Framework. This is a basis for Sicredi’s Positive Impact Measurement, bringing indicators that allow us to measure our sustainability performance at national, regional and local levels. The material is the result of a great deal of collaborative work that took place throughout 2021. The process included discussions with representatives from across the System, who would compose it, in addition to an evaluation by the College of Executive Directors and recommendation by the Foundation Committee and deliberation by the Board of Directors of the SicrediPar. Since its implementation for cooperatives, in 2022, the Reference has been used as an internal tool to measure the sustainability performance of System entities. In view of this, the analysis of results is considered a minimum agenda for all sustainability committees. Based on the set of indicators presented in the Reference, we provide cooperatives with an online tool (dashboard) that presents their performance data, based on the Executive Vision of the Reference. Through it, it is possible to generate reports to monitor the entity's performance over time and its stage of maturity. SICREDI'S SYSTEMIC COMMITMENTS In 2022, we began the process of building our Public Sustainability Commitments. At this first moment, we carried out an analysis sector and Sustainability references, bringing important elements to the discussion for decision making. We build a map that identifies opportunities for themes to outline objectives, initiatives and metrics. In 2023, we will continue the collective construction of our systemic objectives and goals. 52GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGYBusiness sustainability indicators EXECUTIVE SUSTAINMENT INDICATORS 2021 2022 Account holders assets (percentage) ȈȃɈȅȇʣ ȈȆɈȂȈʣ NPS (percentage) ȈȅɈȉʣ ȈȅɈȅʣ General principality (percentage) ȄȄɈȉȈʣ 39.40% Market share of deposits in the coverage area (percentage) 3.4% 3.8% Total net worth (billions) 24.9 30.3 UŠēĿČĚ ēĚ ĚǶČĿğŠČĿî îŏku dos (quantity) ȅɍȊȁȂɍȈȃȅ ȆɍȆȈȊɍȂȇȂ 6,488,112 Social 26 Cooperatives (quantity) 108 108 105 Social 13 Employees (quantity) 29,830 ȄȅɍȂȃȈ 38,816 Social 150 Associates who participated in assemblies (thousands)286 299 440 Social 61 Associates who participated in assemblies (percentage)9.4% ȆɈȈʣ ȈɈȅʣ Social 61 Core coordinators (quantity)11,238 12.90 8 ȂȄɍȂȁȈ Social 63 Participating Associates of the Crescer Program (quantity)48,161 ȈȁɍȁȂȁ 120,894 Governance ȈȈ Core coordinators trained in basic training–ȄȊɈȈʣ 60% Governance Ȉȉ Counselors trained in basic training– 58.4% ȇȆɈȈʣ Governance Ȉȉ Entities with Sustainability Committees – 52 ȈȈ Governance 44 Women in leadership positions – total Elected (core coordinators, counselors and presidents) + statutory + CLT–ȄȁɈȈȈʣ ȄȂɈȇȈʣ Governance 84 Young people in leadership positions – total Elected (coordinators of nucleus, advisors and presidents) + statutory + CLT – 22.41% 21.65% Governance 84 53 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS Sicredi SR 03 | SR 06 2020 2021 2022VALUE GENERATIONPAGE Amount invested in the Economy ƭŕƥƭƑî ĲĚŞĿŠĿŠî ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ 18.24 ȂȈɈȆȅ 18.08 Economic 120 Low Agriculture îƑċūŠū ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ4,061 6,666 8,285 Economic 120 ūîƙ ƎƑïƥĿČîƙ îĳƑŁČūŕ îƙ ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ 1,525 2,249 2,421 Economic 120 Renewable Energy and Sustainability ŞċĿĚŠƥîŕ ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ2,356 4,531 6,136 Economic 120 Operations for energy ƙūŕîƑ ɚ¤ɷɰċĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ1.6 3.3 3.5 Economic 119 Absolute greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) ¹21,358.98 ȃȁɍȇȄȇɈȁȈ 28,368.55 Environmental ȂȄȈ Total emissions per employee (tCO2e/ collaborator)ȁɈȈ 0.6 ȁɈȈ Environmental ȂȄȈ National Week of Financial Education Actions Impacted people (millions) 4.4 19 20 Social 90 1 The results presented in the table consider the total emissions following the energy purchase choice approach in the Scope two. 2 The data considers the result distributed in meetings plus the payment of interest to equity, the value of which is presented in the line ƙƭċƙĚƐƭĚŠƥĚɍ ~ƙ ƑĚƙƭŕƥîēūƙ ēĿƙƥƑĿċƭŁēūƙ ĚŞ îƙƙĚŞċŕĚ Ŀî ČūƑƑĚƙƎūŠēĚŞ î ¤ɷɰȆȃȇ ŞĿŕĺƉĚƙ ĚŞ ȃȁȂȉɈ ¤ɷɰȇȈȁ ŞĿŕĺƉĚƟ SUSTAINABILITYLOCAL DEVELOPMENT ΂®ňĐƛğėňͨ'i̐̓΂ 2020 2021 2022 VALUE GENERATED PAGE Municipalities where we are present (quantity)1,463 1,600 ȂɍȈȊȇ Social ȃȈ Municipalities with less than 100 thousand inhabitants (percentage)ȉȈʣ 86% 86% Social ȃȈ Municipalities in which we are the only one ĿŠƙƥĿƥƭĿďĈū ǶŠîŠČĚĿƑî ɚƐƭîŠƥĿēîēĚɛ216 230 ȃȂȈ Social ȃȈ Amount paid to suppliers ŕūČîĿƙ ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ ȆȈȇɈȂȉ ȉȆȁɈȈ 2,460.4 Social 145 Result distributed to the ēĚ TŠǄĚƙƥĿŞĚŠƥū ¬ūČĿîŕ ɚ¤ɷɰŞĿŕĺƉĚƙɛ – 158.8 301.3 Social 161 UŠēĿČĚ ēĚ ūŠǶîŠďî ēūƙ ČūŕîċūƑîēūƑĚƙ - 88% 89% Social 160 Actions taken on Day C (quantity) 1,033 1,018 3,514 Social ȂȈȁ Education programs for children and adolescents A União Faz a Vida Program Participating municipalities (quantity) ȅȈȆ ȅȈȃ ȆȈȇ Social ȂȈȃ Participating schools (quantity) 2,641 ȃɍȇȄȈ 2,945 Social ȂȈȃ Participating educators (quantity) 23,314 34,953 ȅȃɍȈȄȉ Social ȂȈȃ Children and adolescents (quantity) age) 282,201 ȅȄȈɍȁȈȁ ȆȁȈɍȁȈȅ Social ȂȈȃ School Cooperative Program Participating municipalities (quantity) Ȉȇ 82 119 Social ȂȈȅ Participating schools (quantity) 145 152 ȃȁȈ Social ȂȈȅ Participating educators (quantity) - - 320 Social ȂȈȅ Children and adolescents (quantity) ȅɍȊȊȈ 4,139 ȇɍȆȈȁ Social ȂȈȅ Financial Education Day 4 Municipalities participants (quantity) - - 125 Social 95 Participating schools (quantity) - - 331 Social 95 Participating educators (quantity) - - 2,308 Social 95 Children and adolescents - - 35,128 Social 95 3 Indicator started to be monitored in 2021. 4 Inclusion of data from the Financial Education Day in 2022. 55 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Financial Performance Market context Throughout 2022, we operated in the midst of an economic context ēĚƙîǶîēūƑɈ Šū Ɛƭîŕ î ĚČūŠūŞĿî had favorable growth, but with high interest rates and an increase in defaults.

Therefore, the assembly is the supreme body of the cooperative society, essential to our governance model. It is the maximum moment of democratic decision-making, where members exercise their role as owners, monitoring and deciding the direction of their cooperative. To the Assemblies are spaces for empowering associates, where each one is a protagonist in building the future of the business, transforming the reality and living conditions of communities. In the System, each entity has an important role in the assemblies. Cooperatives are responsible for conducting the decision-making process with their members, providing information and adequate access to events. The centers support the cooperatives in this process. The Sicredi Foundation has the role of structuring and providing solutions that facilitate this process and allow the participation of more and more members, with quality and transparency.

Through it, we promote the democratic participation of members with all the convenience of the digital model, reducing travel and facilitating access, in addition to promoting accessibility for those who may have limitations in participating in person. The platform makes it possible to hold digital events or semi-presential, with live or recorded broadcasts, and voting on deliberation matters. Members can clarify their doubts and register their considerations and comments through a chat channel. The tool was made available in 2021 at a time of pandemic, with restrictions on holding in-person events and, during this period, it became essential for members to could remain close to their cooperatives, exercising their role as owner safely and responsibility.

Furthermore, the Platform brings new functionalities, a dynamic experience for the user, integration with the course platform and aims to bring the entities of its leaders even more. With the aim of providing participation in the cooperative's management and development process, members are grouped into nuclei and organized by the Pertencer Program. Core assemblies are important meetings to strengthen the relationship and transparency of our business, as they are where debates and decisions on matters of collective interest to the cooperative take place. In their assemblies, all Associates can monitor accountability, evaluate actions and initiatives developed, contribute suggestions, clarify doubts and address other issues.

Respect for the privacy of data subjects who interact with Sicredi (whether members or non-members) is a fundamental precept within the organization's banking and service activities. To support this program, we have a distributed structure – with the coordination of actions being carried out by the Data Protection and Privacy management, located at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, and with responsible parties (in charge of data and their respective auxiliaries) in each entity of the System (single cooperatives, central and centralizing entities) for the adjustments of their activities. In the formal regulatory structure focused on data privacy, we have internal and external policies, which stipulate the main processes, roles and responsibilities regarding the discipline. The data protection and privacy program has four basic pillars to support it. •Legal pillar: which evaluates all contractual relationships that we have with other parties – whether they are associates, non-associates, suppliers, partners, third parties and other stakeholders with necessary legal binding. It is important to mention here that the contractual legal business relationship has not been and will not be changed – due to the existence of a legal basis with associates that authorizes the legitimate interest or execution of contracts to complete the perfect legal relationship between these parties. •Technology pillar of information: which evaluates the structural part of the IT infrastructure (and, consequently, information technology) to validate security adequacy compatible with regulatory requirements. Find out more at: https://www.sicredi.com.br/ site /protecao-e-privacidade/ 73 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022•Processes pillar: which evaluates in particular the processing of personal data carried out in each Sicredi product and service (at any level, be it CAS – considering systemic processes, central and cooperatives) and the Data Ombudsman (OTDs), which perform the regulatory role of recording data processing. •Training and awareness pillar: which works on all necessary actions to change culture regarding the use of personal data. This pillar is considered to be of fundamental importance: even implementing all the necessary procedures of the other pillars (considered technical), if the behavior of persons executing processes in relation to data processing do not comply with the attributes of the law, events of non-observance of data privacy practices will continue to exist. 'ƭƑîŠƥĚ ȃȁȃȃɈ ĲūƑîŞ îƥĚŠēĿēîƙ ȊɍȁȂȈ requests from data subjects – procedure provided for by the LGPD, where data subjects can ask data controllers how their information is being treated, with whom it is shared, corrections of information, deletion or mandatory anonymization of data and other information provided for by legislation. There is no deadline for these requests provided for by law, but the current understanding assumes that these responses must be made within 15 days. The average of our Service Level Agreement (SLA) was 3.94 days.

The interviews are carried out over the phone and the NPS is generated based on the answers to the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Sicredi to a friend or colleague?” NPS allows us to identify how satisfactory the relationship experience with our brand is to the point that our associates become promoters of it. Promoters are associates who stay with us longer, consume more products, support the prospecting of new members and have a greater chance of becoming loyal.

One of the improvements made during the year was withdrawals via Pix, allowing anyone, member or not, to make withdrawals from accredited agents through Pix transfers, facilitating access to money. Also for this channel, the payment of taxes in the state of Santa Catarina was released, increasing the channel's portfolio and access to more financial services. ΂I¦U΁H®̑̔΂ Regarding structures and processes, we streamlined the association's process by removing the obligation to physically present proof of residence, and included a self-declaration term about residence in the contract.

A highlight was the Sicredi app, through which we seek to offer a complete relationship for our members, with self-service and personalized incentives. In 2022, we made advances in both functionalities and offering actions, meeting the needs of members and bringing more convenience and ease and adding points of relationship with our audiences.

GRI FS7 | FS8 We consider it important to create financial solutions that, in addition to improving the lives of associates, generate a positive impact on society and the environment, contributing for the action agenda against global climate change. We therefore offer a series of credit lines aligned with the Green Economy, a classification given to financial products and services that enable the improvement of people's well-being and social equality, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcity. GRI FS7 | FS8 The Green Economy's main pillars are: •Low carbon emissions; •Efficiency in the use of resources; •A social inclusion. In 2022, we will allocate ¦Ί΂͓̓̔̒΁ĎňşłƓğƣ΁ğŨ΁ credit aimed at the Green Economy. GRI FS7 | FS8To carry out a survey of which financial solutions fall within this line, we used Febraban's green taxonomy methodology as a basis, which considers sectoral criteria and financing lines and programs with environmental and social benefits, allowing greater standardization in the measurements of the national financial system . GRI FS7 | FS8 Throughout 2020, Febraban carried out a review of the parameters and guidelines of the Green Economy taxonomy in conjunction with a consultancy specialized in the topic and the support of the financial institutions involved in the process. Therefore, as in 2021, in 2022 we will continue to review our internal methodology aimed at measuring this data. In this update, the classification criteria were revised, with increases in existing classifications, as well as the insertion of new lines sustainable projects aligned with Sicredi’s strategies. GRI FS7 | FS8 One of the highlights among the products aligned with the Green Economy is financing for solar energy, through which members can obtain credit to purchase equipment and technology to capture solar energy and generate clean electrical energy in their homes, businesses and properties rural.

GRI 3-3 Based on the lines of defense model, risk teams act independently from the business areas and internal audit, dedicated to identifying, controlling and mitigating factors that may compromise the sustainability of the business in the short, medium and long term, contributing to the maintenance of our solidity and confidence. We consider in our risk management process: Strategic risks, risks Risks are assessed for each new action that could potentially increase its impact on our results, equity and liquidity, considering, whenever possible, stress scenarios and mitigating measures. GRI 3-3 Its management includes monitoring indicators and monthly reporting to the committees that support Sicredipar's Board of Directors in deliberations related to risk management policies and guidelines and the prudential limits to be observed. GRI 3-3 The Board has the support of the Risks and Compliance Committee to identify risks and opportunities related to the topics discussed. 124GUARANTEE INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENTThus, we guarantee the effectiveness of the process, working to evaluate the most comprehensive technical aspects of risks and reporting or indicating actions to the Board for specific deliberations. Our policies and standards comply with legal requirements and market practices and are reviewed annually, with the aim of maintaining the consistency of guidelines, rules and procedures. The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) is a systemic document that aligns our appetite with the different types of risk, in addition to facilitating the dissemination of the risk management culture in the System. Our appetite for risk is informed by our strategic vision. All institutions that make up the System must follow the RAS and all actions contained in the strategic planning must be compatible with the risk appetite described in the document. STRESS TESTS To evaluate potential impacts of adverse events on the business, we developed a Stress Testing Program. SASB FN-CB-550 a.2 The methodologies used in stress tests must be compatible with the risk management needs of each institution. The stress testing program for all institutions in the System must use, at a minimum, the methodologies and procedures required for their respective segment. Program methodologies and procedures must ensure the use of appropriately severe adverse assumptions and parameters. Stress tests must be carried out in an integrated manner for all risks, evaluating the impact of provided for in the Program. Each institution's Stress Testing Program is submitted for approval to the respective Board of Directors. The results of the Stress Test Program for cooperatives, central offices and the Bank's Prudential Conglomerate are assessed by the Risk Committee of SicrediPar and Banco, as well as by the Executive Board, through its advisory forum, the Technical Risk Committee.

GRI FS5 127 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022SELF-DECLARATION SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONNAIRES In our credit granting process, we apply self-declaratory questionnaires to associates whose activities have greater exposure to socio-environmental risks, functioning as a flag of possible problems or irregularities. From this, a qualitative assessment of the document is carried out, supporting decision-making. for concessions to this member. In line with the social, environmental and climate agenda, in 2022 we expanded the implementation of questionnaires for granting credit to legal entities in the mining sector. Thus, throughout the year we had 58,009 questionnaires in force, of which 56.52% were applied to legal entity (PJ) members, a significantly higher number than the previous year.

Within the scope of Sicredi Serrana, in the first year water capture systems, protection of springs and restoration of permanent preservation areas (APPs) were built in 23 rural properties in municipalities in the regions of Caxias do Sul and Lajeado. Over the next two years, another 115 properties will benefit. In the region covered by Sicredi Pioneira, where the project began in October, 66 springs will be restored or preserved on 66 rural properties. Of this amount, 11 are APPs, called URs – Reference Units, one in each municipality, with in-depth preservation and restoration work. Upon completion, each UR will be suitable for visitation, educational and awareness-raising purposes. In the remaining 55 properties, the focus of the work will be the preservation of springs. At the end of the projects, the areas will be available for visitation, for educational and awareness raising.

Therefore, during 2022, we evolved our corporate education strategy, establishing a new learning culture based on the ecosystem concept. GRI 3-3 This change adds a dynamic component to the learning process, creating new ways of learning and sharing knowledge. With this evolution, our learning strategy demonstrates that we are attentive to the ways in which knowledge and information are produced, made available and accessed. GRI 3-3 Our Learning Ecosystem is made up of three pillars, which respect and preserve the autonomy of the entities that make up the System, in addition to enhancing the learning of our different audiences, whether internal or external, aligned with the execution of our strategy and to inspirational 2030. PILLARS OF LEARNING ECOSYSTEM SICREDI COMPETENCIES To maintain the alignment of our culture, we have a catalog of 15 competencies that describe the desired behaviors and guide our employee selection, development and recognition processes. They are fundamental to connecting us to our purpose and showing that change is necessary, while maintaining our cooperative essence. Sicredi RC09 Two of these competencies were indicated as essential for the entire System. They are: “Cooperative essence” and “Understand to serve”. The remaining skills are the free choice of each individual. informally, fostering the growth of each person and the organization as a whole. That Culture is built through values, which must be communicated to direct the attitudes and behaviors we want to see in the different audiences involved with our learning initiatives. The values ​​of our learning culture are: •Sicredi Essence; •Learner Centrality; •Autonomy and Protagonism; •Human Context of Learning; •360º learning; •Network Learning; •Innovability. Learning architecture The design of the Learning Architecture aims to facilitate connections between initiatives, bringing a systemic view of actions and supporting the construction and distribution process with the aim of improving your experience. The Learning Architecture ensures the link between business needs and training initiatives, allowing employees to have a better view of the paths and purposes of initiatives, increasing their engagement and autonomy. The thematic axes of our Learning Ecosystem are: •Cooperative Identity; •Skills and Transformation; •Relationship and Business; •Tools, technologies and methods; •Leadership; •Regulatory; •Governance*. * This axis will be made available in 2023. 152PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLE Ecosystem management Learning Ecosystem Management aims to direct Corporate Learning strategies and support the sustainability of the Ecosystem Model. It is made up of mechanisms, processes and relationships that direct learning and determine responsibilities and priorities, driving decision making. Through cooperation, we gain in scale and simultaneously maintain the advantages of unit independence and the maintenance of some centralized activities. 153 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Sicredi Aprendi To ensure a îƎƑĚŠēĿǕîēū ĚǶČîǕɈ ƭƥĿŕĿǕîŞūƙ î Sicredi Aprendi platform, through which we manage and We make our Corporate Learning programs and initiatives available, which can take the form of online content as well as synchronous and in-person training.

With each challenge completed, employees were able to redeem their points for learning rewards. What's more, connected with our cooperative purpose and essence, the points of all participants were added together to achieve the collective goal, which was achieved and converted into financial support for those who need it most. So, together we made a difference, and benefited APAE Brasil, a project chosen by all collaborators. In total, 33,225 employees completed one or more challenges. With the positioning of the Learning Ecosystem, we understand that learning is the sum of formal and informal initiatives. With this, we have the ongoing challenge of stimulating new ways of learning, creating spaces for people to share, teach, learn, unlearn and relearn, all together and integrated. To monitor our progress and assess whether we are achieving our objective, we carry out the Perception Survey. 92% assessed that the Ecosystem increased learning possibilities. 159 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022Employee satisfaction In 2022, we continued to use the Great Place to Work (GPTW) methodology to carry out our climate research.

To the Shareholders, Advisors and Administrators of the Cooperative Credit System –Sicredi Porto Alegre -RS Introduction We were hired by the Cooperative Credit System –Sicredi (“Sicredi”) to present our limited assurance report on the indicators and own sustainability metrics contained in Sicredi's 2022 Annual Sustainability Report (“Report”), relating to the year ended December 31, 2022. Our limited assurance does not extend to information from previous periods or any other information disclosed in conjunction with the Report, including any embedded images, audio files or videos. Sicredi administration responsibilities Sicredi administration is responsible for: xSelect and establish appropriate criteria for preparing the information contained in the Report; xPrepare indicators in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI Standards”), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board – Banco Comercial (“SASB”) and own criteria regarding sustainability metrics; xDesign, implement and maintain internal control over information relevant to the preparation of indicators and metrics specific to sustainability contained in the Report, which are free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. Responsibility of independent auditors Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report, based on limited assurance work carried out in accordance with Technical Announcement CTO 07 – 2022 issued by the CFC, and based on NBC TO 3000 – Assurance work Different from Audit and Review, also issued by the CFC, which is equivalent to the international standard ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). These standards require the auditor to comply with ethical requirements, independence and other related responsibilities, including the application of the Brazilian Quality Control Standard (NBC PA 01) and, therefore, the maintenance of a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures on compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 204ANNEXOSEY I 2/ 3Additionally, the aforementioned standards require that the work be planned and executed with the objective of obtaining limited assurance that the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report, taken together, are free from material distortions. Limited assurance work conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) consists mainly of inquiries to Sicredi management and other Sicredi professionals who are involved in preparing the information, as well as the application of analytical procedures to obtain evidence that make it possible to conclude, in the form of limited assurance, on the information taken together. A limited assurance work It also requires the execution of additional procedures when the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead him to believe that the sustainability indicators and metrics disclosed in the Report, taken together, may present relevant distortions. The procedures selected were based on our understanding of aspects relating to the compilation, materiality and presentation of the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report. ory, other circumstances of the work and our consideration of areas and processes associated with the material information disclosed in the Report, in which relevant distortions could exist. The procedures included, among others: a) work planning, considering the relevance, the volume of quantitative and qualitative information and the operational and internal control systems that served as the basis for the elaboration of the indicators and specific metrics of sustainability contained in the Report; b) understanding the calculation methodology and procedures for compiling indicators through inquiries with managers responsible for preparing the information; c) the application of analytical procedures on quantitative information and inquiries into qualitative information and its correlation with the sustainability indicators and metrics disclosed in the information contained in the Report; d) for cases in which sustainability indicators and metrics correlate with indicators of a financial nature, the comparison of these indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records. The limited assurance work also included adherence to the guidelines and criteria of the GRI Standards, SASB and own criteria applicable to the development of the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report. We believe that the evidence obtained without our work is sufficient and appropriate to support our conclusion in a limited way. Scope and limitations Procedures performed in limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are smaller in extent than in reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of security obtained in limited assurance work is substantially lower than that which would be obtained if it had been carried out reasonable assurance work. If we had carried out reasonable assurance work, we could have identified other issues and possible distortions that may exist in the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report. Therefore, we do not express an opinion on this information. 205 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022EY Assurance Report I 3/ 3 Non-financial data is subject to more inherent limitations than non-financial data financial, given the nature and diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate or estimate these data. Qualitative interpretations of materiality, relevance and accuracy of data are subject to individual assumptions and judgments. Additionally, we did not carry out any work on data reported for previous periods, nor in relation to future projections and goals. The preparation and presentation of sustainability indicators and metrics followed the criteria of GRI Standards, SASB and their own and, therefore, do not have the objective of ensuring compliance with social, economic, environmental or engineering laws and regulations. The aforementioned standards, however, provide for the presentation and disclosure of possible non-compliance with such regulations when significant sanctions or fines occur. Our assurance report must be read and understood in this context, inherent to the selected criteria (GRI Standards eSASB). Conclusion With based on the procedures carried out, described in this report and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in Sicredi's Report for the year ended December 31, 2020, were not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the criteria and guidelines of the GRI Standards, SASB and our own criteria.
