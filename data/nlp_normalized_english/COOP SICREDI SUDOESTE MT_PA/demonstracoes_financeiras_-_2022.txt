In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended on that date. , in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Council of Accounting, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Company's Report management and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for the internal controls that it determined were necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the statements. financial institutions, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the statements financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or jointly, may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, Regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the accounting basis for operational continuity and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, March 14, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 We ended the year with 22 new branches opened in the state of Pará. We are present in 45 municipalities in the state of Pará and 22 municipalities in Mato Grosso with more than 200 thousand members in 73 branches. Seeking to meet the satisfaction of our associates, we can highlight our NPS, which was 73.9, a result of the continuous effort to increasingly exercise and experience good practices. We achieved excellent financial results in 2022 with a team of employees made up of more than 1022 people. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: All of our agencies also promoted education and cooperation initiatives. The Pertencer Program held 8 editions of the Cooperative Chat, an exclusive moment with the Center Coordinators where we provided information about the Cooperative and cooperativism. We recorded the numbers of 212 coordinators present at the Core General Assembly and 138 coordinators present at the Ordinary General Assembly. With Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis, the number of people from Pará and Mato Grosso involved in the initiative exceeds 68 thousand. The Crescer Program, which aims to interact with cooperative members, non-cooperative members, counselors, core coordinators and employees so that they better understand the operation and benefits of the Cooperative, carried out more than 16 thousand training sessions in 2022. Talking about the Social Fund, in 2022 we allocated 1 million reais to support 83 entities through projects involving Sicredi's Corporate Citizenship, Cooperation, Education and local Development, positively impacting thousands of people. An overview of PUFV in 2022 showed growth compared to 2021. The Program was present in 11 municipalities, 49 schools involving more than 17 thousand students and 839 educators. We are expanding our operations and understand that the diversity of ideas, generations and opinions contribute to our corporate environment. Through the Geração Diamante Program, 10 employees over the age of 55 joined our team to contribute their experiences, an unprecedented initiative at the Cooperative to promote inclusion and diversity.

In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts:Administration Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve conditions of life of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw a increased inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth . In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and must follow at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the market of work contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied due to the increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented In the next years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous societyRecognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies for Work, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the highest rating in the agency, moving from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same magazine that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in terms of physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will follow building a more prosperous society.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed at each semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realization or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to comply with the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in the payment of the principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The detail of the provision for losses it is presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss forecasts assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the entity's probability of disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the existing uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through sources external, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, market risks and yours financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding.

To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation results (NII) approaches are used. The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for managing the IRRBB risk of the Sicredi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the dimension of exposure to IRRBB risk of the System's institutions. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the adopted business continuity strategies are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard provide for the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure an adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the entities' most critical processes. The Business Continuity Management system structured in Sicredi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and IT disaster recovery strategies; Finally, Sicredi makes available to all its agencies a model of agency continuity manual, which allows the creation of a document customized, in order to meet the main activity interruption scenarios=. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in the market values ​​of positions held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices. Market risk management of institutions in the Sicredi System is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing market risk. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (GCN) is the organization's ability to continue delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to the recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments arising from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. Said plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Singular Cooperatives during the year 2022. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the implementation plan of said regulation: a) Summary of Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan.
