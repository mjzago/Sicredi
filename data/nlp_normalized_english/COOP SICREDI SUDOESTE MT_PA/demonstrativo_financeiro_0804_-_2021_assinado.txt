In this context, the value and scores correspond to the exercise ending on December 3, 1, 2020, to be presented in order to compare. ã o , were adjusted and are being 2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification. Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated . If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities board and governance of the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. At preparation of the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board intends liquidate the Cooperative or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for governance of the Cooperatives are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with the standards Brazilian and international auditing companies, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting distortion material resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We assess the suitability of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our works. Porto Alegre, March 3, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 ADMINISTRATION REPORT In this document, the administration of the Sicredi Sicredi Sudoeste MT/PA cooperative, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the report independent auditors on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improve the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in media Electronic customer service systems (ATMs, internet banking, app), which made many of our demands viable as these are complete channels that allow most operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we returned to operating face-to-face in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During the year, the cooperative was actively involved in offering products and services that could meet the needs of its members, as well as expanding its service network to promote financial inclusion and bring credit cooperatives as a financial alternative to more people. In 2021, we opened 10 new branches and began work on implementing others in the state doPará. With this, the Cooperative closes the 2021 financial year with a total of 51 branches, now with a physical agency in all cities in its area of ​​operation in the state of Mato Grosso. On another front, the cooperative has undertaken numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Among them we highlight the creation of the Social Fund, which allocated financial resources to 30 Institutions that registered their projects in 15 municipalities, directly benefiting more than 26 thousand people, and the Day of Cooperation, in which the cooperative, members, collaborators and partners came together and collected more than 100 tons of food that were delivered to 116 assistance entities, serving more than 15 thousand people with food. The programs “União faz a Vida”, “Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis”, “Recoverando Nascentes” and “Crescer”, in addition to many other actions, also took place throughout the year, positively impacting thousands of people in our communities. Our work resulted in partnerships, development and recognition. We received the international Great Place do Work (GPTW) certification, which identifies us as one of the best companies to work for in the country. And, for the 5th consecutive edition, we received the Management Excellence Award from Sescoop and the National Quality Foundation, now in the Commitment to Excellence category, Silver classification.

The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centers via Centralization Financial are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and must be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to non-operating income or losses is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified balances by nature into groups of other income accounts and operating revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses, for the purpose of promoting the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility in a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify it as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03.

CPR operations are carried out with associates as long as they are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee instrument, the joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system are considered to define a single spread for all counterparties. Fund shares are valued daily, through the value of the share, published by the fund administrator on the CVM and ANBIMA website. 404,134 Rural and agro-industrial financing 996 38,011 303,495 253,862 596,364 817,182 Financing 1,244 42,879 139,502 277,512 461,137 273,278 Loans and discounted securities 43,915 235,922 537,135 740,311 1,557,283 1,933 Securities and credits receivable (Note 0 8) - 145,531 54,193 302 200,026 100,037 Debtors for the purchase of valuables and goods (Note 08) - 319 712 2,041 3,072 1,494,594 Guarantees and guarantees honored (Note 08) 537 - - - 537 542 Total credit operations 46,155 316,812 980,132 1,271,685 2,614,784 Total non-current 1,274,028 610,784 Total current 1,544,391 986,322 102,512 Total portfolio 46,692 462,662 1,035,037 1,274,028 2,818,419 1.59 7,106 Total other credits 537 145,850 54,905 2,343 203,635 A 0.50 1,417,193 730,865 7,080 3,645 12/31/2020 AA - 115,231 64,461 - - b) Composition of the credit portfolio by risk levels Risk levels % ProvisionCredit operations and Other credits Provision for expected losses associated with the risk CREDIT 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 12/31/2021 D 10.00 72,788 56,840 7,274 5,683 C 3.00 215,298 155,067 6,456 4,638 B 1.00 877,446 501,773 8.769                                         5.007  G 70,00                                       16.550                             12.422                                    11.585                                         8.695 F 50,00                                       14.258                               5.084                                      7.129                                         2.542 E 30,00                                       34.502                             18.923 10,351 5,677 As provided in Art. 5th of BACEN Resolution No. 4,800/20, the provision for losses for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must only apply to the amount equivalent to the Equity allocated for this purpose, these values ​​are being presented together with the amount provisioned for credit and other credits.
