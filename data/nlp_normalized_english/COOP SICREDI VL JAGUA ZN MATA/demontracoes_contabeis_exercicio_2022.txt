Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Code of Ethics Professional Accountant and professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the management report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 Conjunto A - Bloco A 1st floor - room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF - Brazil Tel : +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.brIn connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is, in a material manner, inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for preparing and adequately presenting financial statements. financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any relevant distortions that exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout of the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from an error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing the internal controls, collusion, falsification, omission or intentional misrepresentation.  Obtain an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls .  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity . If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, February 27, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC- RS062793/O-8We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we impact positively the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with the fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of increasing interest rates on economies advances contributed to the repricing of risk assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the cycle of rising interest rates with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the family income condition. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society In continuity with the expansion project for the State of Minas Gerais, on 07/08/22 we opened an agency in the city of Matias Barbosa, on 07/29/22 we opened an agency in the city of Santos Dumont, on 12/08/2022 we opened an agency in the city of Bicas and on 12/09/2022 we opened an agency in city ​​of Carandaí. On December 2, 2022, we reopened an agency in the city of Jaguari-RS, a rented and completely new building, built to meet the needs of the agency and our associates. To expand sustainability actions in 2022, we promoted and released several credit operations for solar energy. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: 1- União Faz a Vida Program we were in 9 municipalities, providing pedagogical advice to 731 educators in more than 560 projects. 2- Financial education actions were available year-round for members and non-members, intensifying with participation in ENEF week, in total 80 actions were registered, with the participation of 4,226 impacted people, in online and in-person format. 3- C-Day in all our agencies, focusing on the SDGs and volunteering, 21 actions were carried out, with 1,122 volunteers, impacting more than 9,145 people, through actions such as: afternoon snacks and games at schools, Asylum day with beauty salon, lunch and dance, blood donation, slipper collection , food, clothes, toys, games, revitalization of city sites and much more. 4- Crescer Program, we trained 1,319 members and held 49 core meetings, providing information about the Cooperative's planning to the associated. 5-Social Fund we had more than 100 projects registered in our 2022 Regulations, where 92 projects were approved, with a total value of more than R$524 thousand.
