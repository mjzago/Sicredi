In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Vale do Jaguari e Zona da Mata - Sicredi Vale do Jaguari and Zona da Mata RS/MG on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Bank Central do Brasil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding amounts We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for revenue financial intermediation, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Policies Accounting, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification. Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise otherwise, it appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. No We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements free from distortion material, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on said statements. financial. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, as well as obtain appropriate audit evidence and enough to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We have obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative’s internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the ability to continue as a going concern operation of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit engagements and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through the credit lines granted to members in cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, the which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of electronic customer service solutions (ATMs, internet banking, app), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and service via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we highlight the following administrative facts: - Completion of the Solar Energy project to supply the Santiago agency (headquarters); - Expansion of actions aimed at sustainability from the release of several credit operations to promote solar energy initiatives; - Reopening of the branch in the municipality of São Francisco de Assis (RS), a rented and completely new building, built to meet the needs of the operation and our associates; - Opening of two new branches in Minas Gerais, one in Pequeri and the other in São João Nepomuceno, continuing our expansion project in the state. On another front, the cooperative took part in numerous initiatives to contribute with the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: - A União Faz a Vida Program: we were in nine municipalities, providing pedagogical advice to 587 educators in more than 400 projects; - Financial Education Program: throughout the year we promoted 121 actions (online and in person). In total, 74,928 people were impacted; Crescer Program: we trained 1,181 members and held 16 core meetings to provide information about planning from the Cooperative to the member. We also trained 45 Core Coordinators in the “+Coop” project, promoted together with the Polytechnic College of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM); - Day C: with actions in all agencies, we collected 15 tons of food, which were donated to people in situations of economic and social vulnerability; - Health: we make investments through the Cooperative's Social Fund to support hospitals, nursing homes and entities. In addition, we work hard to ensure that member demands were met, especially those related to tackling the pandemic and economic recovery. Among the actions, we highlight the adherence of our employees to working from home and the incentive campaigns aimed at associates regarding the use of cell phone applications for financial transactions and the possibility of scheduling appointments. At agencies, we provide alcohol gel, install sanitizing mats, advise the use of masks and reinforce cleaning and cleaning of work areas. #ASSETS 1,024,952 760,054 LIABILITIES 754,452 521,345 CASH (Note 04) 3,674 3,550 DEPOSITS (Note 12) 371,882 291,174 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 997,221 743,267 Demand deposits 155,413 110,859 Interbank liquidity applications (Note 05) 13,415 12,653 Interbank deposits 17,791 6,215 Securities (Note 06) 175,291 141,162 Term deposits 198,678 174,100 Financial centralization (Note 04) 79,764 57,975 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 339,218 200,044 Interbank relations 149 72 Interbank relations (Note 13) 336,145 196,940 Credit operations (Note 07) 699,125 512,582 Onlending obligations es (Note 14) 382 621 Other financial assets (Note 08) 29,477 18,823 Other financial liabilities (Note 15) 2,691 2,483 PROVISIONS FOR EXPECTED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT RISK (Note 07) (20,055) (19,730) PROVISIONS FOR CIVIL, TAX AND LABOR RISKS (Note 16) 134 5 OTHER ASSETS (Note 09) 2,626 1,260 OTHER LIABILITIES (Note 17) 43,218 30,122 INVESTMENTS (Note 10) 23 .766 16,720 FIXED ASSETS IN USE (Note 11) 14,661 11,269 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Note 18) 270,500 238,709 INTANGIBLE (Note 11) 3,059 3,718 SHARE CAPITAL 79,911 81,609 SURPLUS RESERVES 181,951 151,926 ACU LEFTOVERS OR LOSSES MULADAS 8,638 5,174 TOTAL ASSETS 1,024,952 760,054 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 1,024,952 760,054 The explanatory notes are an integral part of the Financial StatementsBALANCE SHEET (In thousands of Reais) Cooperativa de Crédito, Savings and Investment Vale do Jaguari and Zona da Mata -

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF REAIS) STATEMENTS OF SURPLUS AND LOSSES Previously Presented Reclassification Represented 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council - CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil - BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20, which regulated procedures for the preparation and disclosure of financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN were also observed. (CPCs 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71, with changes by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Deposit inflows intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows from intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and must be considered as income and income financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centrals via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is (b) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which are immediately convertible into a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify them as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the cash and initial and final cash equivalents of the period ending December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of securities where were previously presented. The reclassified values ​​are shown in the tables below: The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules. Sicredi, on December 31, 2021, is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network with 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates in 15 service points. The structure counts also with five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Sicredi Cooperatives (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”). The Cooperative is an integral part of the Credit Cooperativism Guarantee Fund (FGCoop), a non-profit civil association, with legal personality under private law with national coverage, as per Annex I to the resolution of the National Monetary Council ("CMN") no. 4,284, dated November 5, 2013. The purpose of FGCoop is to provide credit guarantees in cases of intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to the limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity with these institutions. The Cooperative is also an integral part of Sicredi Fundos Garantidores, a non-profit company whose formation of reserves comes from monthly and extraordinary contributions of cooperatives associated with the fund whose purpose is to ensure the credibility and solvency of its members. According to the rules established in the Guarantee Fund Regulations, monthly contributions are determined by the sum of two installments: fixed portion, related to the objective of each Fund; and variable portion, relating to the risk attributed to the System (considers levels of liquidity, capital margin and use of security devices). NOTE 02 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (c) Non-operating income Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20 was a change in the way in which the statements of works or losses are presented.
