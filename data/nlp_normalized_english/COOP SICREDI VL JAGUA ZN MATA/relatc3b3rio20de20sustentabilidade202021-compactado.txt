The year was marked by important developments in our governance model, while maintaining the institution's essential values, always bearing in mind the interests of members. Following the succession plan, in which the executive mandates 2018- 2020, the president of Central Sicredi South/Southeast Fernando Dall'Agnese was elected in the 2021 assemblies as the new President of the Board of Directors of SicrediPar, the Confederation Sicredi, the Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, the Board of Sicredi Fundos Garantidores and the Foundation's Board of Trustees. His predecessor, Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock, President of Central Sicredi PR / SP / RJ, continues to be part of SicrediPar's Board of Directors, as representative of the Center and its affiliated cooperatives. The new composition of the Board is also responsible for the transition to the exclusive presidency model, adopted from March 2022, and which puts us towards the best sustainability practices in the market, in line with the new guidelines of the Central Bank. The movements are part of the strategy of continuous evolution of Sicredi's corporate governance, internationally recognized as a model in cooperatives. credit. Another important milestone in our governance was the selection of SicrediPar's first female Independent Director, increasing diversity in our decision-making bodies, which we consider fundamental for the evolution and development of our business and a more prosperous society. The process was conducted throughout the year and the election took place during the SicrediPar General Assembly, in 2022. From the point of view of the local performance of our cooperatives, the year was marked through the continuity of strategy, which prioritizes the generation of value for associates — the business owners. In a context in which the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were still present, cooperatives maintained proximity and support to our members, intensifying the use of different technologies and digital channels, such as assemblies and digital tools and service via Whatsapp. At the same time, we continue to expand our physical presence in the country, with 210 branches opened in all regions of Brazil. In this sense, we continued the national expansion plan, marked by our arrival in Espírito Santo and Amapá, and expanded our service capacity in the state of Minas Gerais. The close relationship was essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, offering financial solutions for micro and small companies, small rural producers, self-employed professionals and other associates, helping to recovery of the local economy. Aiming to maintain support for small entrepreneurs in this context, we carry out credit operations from the National Support Program for Microenterprises and Small Businesses (Pronampe) on a permanent basis. Through this credit, we support 28,077 micro and small companies, at a time of economic recovery. In 2021, we also reinforced our position as the first private financial institution that grants the most credit to agribusiness in Brazil, making more than R$38.2 billion available to producers for the 2021/2022 Harvest Plan. We did all this without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. With this, we structured a Sustainable Finance area, dedicated to raising resources linked to generating value for society and the environment. In this direction, we raised funds with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to meet the growing demand for credit for installation of solar energy systems. The credit line of around R$600 million was the first operation by a Brazilian cooperative financial institution to receive certification issued by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), an organization that works to promote investments in the low-carbon economy. Fernando Dall’Agnese Chairman of the Board of Directors of SicrediPar GRI 102-146 Sustainability Report 2021 7 Introduction We also carried out fundraising aimed at to financing micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women, which generated a credit line of R$438 million. The agreement was signed with DEG, a German financial development institution, a subsidiary of the German Development Bank (KFW), and the French development agency PROPARCO, a subsidiary of the French Development Bank (AFD). The operation included, for the first time in our business, the gender factor as one of the criteria, in addition to considering other social and environmental aspects. Furthermore, we took another important step by launching the first portfolio of ESG investment funds, which seeks to generate value by investing members' money in companies with a proven positive social, environmental and governance impact. Still focusing on sustainability, the year was marked by the structuring of our tool for measuring our positive impact: the Sustainable Development Framework. Through it, we can measure our performance and increasingly evolve the agenda for sustainable development. The tool will be an important support for our sustainability governance model, which provides for Sustainability Committees at all levels of Sicredi: national, regional and local. We currently have committees in approximately 50% of our cooperatives. João Francisco Sanchez Tavares Executive President of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi Fernando Dall’Agnese President of the Board of Directors Administration of SicrediPar Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock President of Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ João Francisco Sanchez Tavares Executive President of Banco Cooperativo SicrediFrom a macroeconomic point of view, the year 2021 was marked by great challenges and opportunities, with some sectors of the economy recovering quickly the effects of the pandemic and others still impacted by the stoppage of activities. Given this scenario, we had a 37% growth in our credit portfolio, based on responsible action and proximity to the member, in line with our principles. At the same time, cooperatives continued to use our non-financial solutions to expand their impact on communities, working with various social programs. A highlight is our financial education program, Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis, which expanded its actions during the year, such as the ENEF 2021 Week, increasingly positioning us as a institution concerned with the financial health of our members. All of these initiatives reinforce our commitment to the Global Compact and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, demonstrating, in practice, how our business generates sustainable development. We signed this letter with six hands to reinforce that we will remain united, taking our products and services to the most distant communities, in order to build more and more together, a more prosperous society.Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock President of Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ 8 Sustainability Report 2021 9 Introduction We present Sicredi's 2021 Sustainability Report. In this document, we present the main highlights of our business throughout the year, including the ESG (environmental, social and governance) aspects and the financial support of the business. Throughout its pages, you will learn how our Financial and non-financial services generate value for associates, employees and communities where we are present, supporting the sustainable development of society. The information reported includes all individual and central cooperatives and companies headquartered in the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). In preparing this document, we followed the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), a voluntary standard adopted by companies from the most diverse sectors and countries for the sustainability reporting. Our sustainability drivers and focal themes, considered those that most impact the sustainability of our cooperatives, served as the basis for establishing the scope of the report, including the indicators reported. We are participants in the Global Compact, an initiative of the United Nations (UN) and, with this, we report how we comply with the 10 Universal Principles of the Global Compact and how we contribute to the 17 Goals of Sustainable Development (SDG). This document was approved by the Board of Directors of Sicredi Participações S.A. (SicrediPar), published at a SicrediPar meeting and subjected to an external verification process conducted by an independent audit. GRI 102-32 About the report You can read this report in a linear fashion. However, you can also browse the publication in alternative ways, in line with our sustainability strategy and guidelines international reporting. Below we demonstrate how we adopted each of these approaches and point to the page where more details can be found. Sustainability drivers and focal themes (page 37) The chapters in this publication were organized according to our sustainability drivers. At the opening of each chapter, we present which focal themes will be covered throughout its pages. Sustainability pillars (page 35) Our initiatives are classified according to the Social, Environmental, Economic and Governance pillars. At the opening of each chapter, we describe which pillar the described initiatives are included in. GRI (page 128) We rely on GRI standards to report our sustainability performance. These contents are identified at the end of each paragraph using the acronym GRI. On page 128, we publish a GRI Content Summary that explains the content and the page on which it is reported. Principles of Global Compact (page 40) We are participants in the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, and this document also seeks to report our progress towards the 10 Universal Principles of the Global Compact. Check on page 128 the correlation of the Global Compact Principles with the GRI content. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (page 40) As signatories to the Global Compact, we also report our contribution to the SDGs. Therefore, at the opening of each chapter we point out the objectives impacted by the reported sustainability driver and, on page 37, we present the correlation between our focal themes and the SDGs. On page 142, we publish an SDG Map, which shows the relationship between each SDG and our initiatives, with the page where they were published. Sicredi indicators (page 128) We report our own sustainability indicators, selected based on our focal themes. These contents are identified at the end of each paragraph by through the acronym SICREDI. In the GRI Content Summary, we explain the content and indicate the page where it is reported.

Their involvement in business management takes place through cooperative assemblies, in which representatives are elected and the direction of the business is decided. SicrediPar's Board of Directors is elected and represents the centers and cooperatives and, therefore, the members, being responsible for deliberating on the System's strategic decisions. SICREDIPAR ADVISORS' ELECTION PROCESS GRI 102-24 ¹ SicrediPar's general assembly elects the Boards of Administration and Tax. However, the five presidents of the centrals have a guaranteed place on the board and the other five vacancies are for presidents of individual cooperatives, nominated by each of the centrals. Furthermore, one vacancy is appointed by Rabo Partnerships B.V. and the other is reserved for an independent advisor. Our decision-making process is democratic and provides security, as it is made up of two complementary lines. The first is the strategic line, which seeks to consider the opinions presented by cooperatives, centrals and the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). The technical areas of the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS) prepare and present proposals, involving the centers, whenever applicable. The representatives of the centrals submit the proposals to the individual cooperatives to collect votes. The representatives of the centrals return the votes of their affiliated cooperatives to the SicrediPar CAD. SicrediPar's Advisory Committees analyze some topics in greater depth and propose recommendations. SicrediPar's Board of Directors (CAD) receives the proposals and forwards them to the individual cooperatives for a vote through the central representatives. The individual cooperatives analyze the proposals and return the vote to the representative of their respective center. After going through the systemic decision flow, the deliberative process is completed, with the appropriate records and formalizations.SYSTEMIC DECISION FLOW STRATEGIC The executive line seeks to execute activities and implement strategic decisions. This line is led by the College of Executive Directors (CDE), made up of the Executive Directors of the centers and the President Director of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi. Governance Portal The Governance Portal is a communication channel between cooperatives and their leaders (core coordinators and advisors). Through it it is possible to share informative materials for support information management with membership leadership.

Starting at 2022 meetings, we adopted the exclusive presidency model, in which the elected Chairman of the Board of Directors will not occupy a strategic or executive position in any other Sicredi entity, without accumulating functions. GRI 102-18 / 102-23In addition, we also had changes to the Board of Directors and the formation of Committees supporting the Board of Directors. The independent director position was filled in March 2022. The selection process included a diversity component and a female Advisor was chosen, elected at the SicrediPar General Assembly in March 2022. GRI 102-18 Leadership remuneration Our remuneration policy aims to reward administrators for actions that guarantee Sicredi's sustainability in the short, medium and long term deadlines. This internal rule takes into account the size of the entities and the composition of their assets. GRI 102-35 There is a short-term annual variable portion, linked to the business performance in the period and a variable long-term portion aimed at retaining statutory employees, business sustainability, career transition and succession. GRI 102-35 Management remuneration is discussed in internal forums, committees and the entities' Board of Directors. Presidents' fees are approved at a general meeting of members and directors' fees are approved by the Board of Directors, both for central and cooperatives. GRI 102-36 / 102-37 Councilors of centrals and cooperatives receive attendance cards or monthly fees approved at a general assembly of members, also taking into account the size of each entity. Similar rules are used for companies based in Centro Administrativo Sicredi (CAS), approved at a general meeting, observing the specific legislation of each company. GRI 102-35/ 102-36 Assessment of the Board of Directors Due to the beginning of the mandate of the new formation of the Board of Directors, we did not carry out the evaluation of the Board in 2021. GRI 102-2833 Sicredi 32 Sustainability Report 2021 Advisory committees Systemic strategy The Board of Directors of Sicredi Participações S.A. is advised by permanent committees, which have the function of analyzing some matters in greater depth and making recommendations to the Board of Directors. We continue to operate based on Inspirational Planning 2030, which consolidated our performance as a System and established our purpose: “to build a more prosperous society together.” In this way, we place positive impact as the focus of our long-term vision, aligning our actions with the principles of cooperativism and sustainable development. We also have as a guide the Strategic Planning cycle 2020 – 2023, which establishes short-term objectives, placing the associate at the center of our business model, and incorporates sustainability as a transversal theme, demonstrating that all systemic actions must comply with the theme's guidelines. Strategy Committee Assists in structuring long-term strategies and in assessments regarding entry into new markets, strategic associations and eventual acquisitions, mergers and sales of System companies, as well as monitoring our strategic drivers. Sicredi Foundation Committee Assists in decisions that encompass the implementation and the development of the systemic sustainability strategy, and educational, social, cultural, environmental and governance programs and initiatives to expand the institution's positive impact.

PEOPLE Having a humanized and inclusive work culture, with pride in what we do it together.Build a more prosperous society together GRI102-1835 O Sicredi 34 Sustainability Report 2021 Sustainability strategy Due to the cooperative nature of our business, the interest in the community, the sense of cooperation and social justice, transparency and duty towards local responsibilities have always been present in our history. In this way, the management model itself has in its essence a sustainable operation. We have a Policy of Sustainability that establishes the principles and guidelines that guide strategy and decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties. GRI FS15 The Policy defines that, for Sicredi, sustainability is business management with a focus on expanding the positive economic, social and environmental impact, reducing adverse impacts and generating value for associates, employees, the community and other interested parties. The management, review, communication and systemic guidance for the implementation and compliance with the Sustainability Policy are the responsibility of SicrediPar's Board of Directors. GRI FS15Sustainability governance The Sustainability Policy establishes that our work on the topic is transversal, that is, it is the responsibility of all employees, regardless of their area of ​​activity or hierarchical level. SicrediPar's Board of Directors is responsible for management, review, communication and systemic guidance for the implementation and compliance with the Policy. GRI 102-19 In the governance of the topic, we have two structures with different responsibilities. One of them is focused on decision-making and has SicrediPar's Board of Directors as responsible for the sustainability issue and for driving the System's strategy, advised by the Foundation Committee. GRI 102-19 The implementation-oriented framework The theme has Sustainability Committees installed at national, regional and local levels, ensuring robust management at all levels of the System, in addition to the commitment of all leaders to the theme. GRI 102-19The Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy establishes the guidelines for managing socio-environmental risks in all entities of the System and in the relationship with associates and other interested parties, preventing the occurrence of financial losses, legal or reputational damages resulting from social, environmental and climate damage. To do this, comply with legal, regulatory and self-regulatory provisions. GRI FS15 The implementation of the Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy is the responsibility of the Executive Risk Board. GRI FS15 Based on these policies, we defined a sustainability strategy that aims to fulfill our mission, vision and purpose, maintaining alignment with our values ​​and other strategic drivers. It guides, in practice, the sustainable development of our business and is divided into a series of components, described in the following pages. To further advance the implementation of our sustainability strategy, in 2021 we began developing Sustainability Guidelines for the Business. This construction concerns a set of guidelines unfolded from the Sustainability Policy, with the aim of providing more clarity and guidance in implementing the sustainability strategy throughout the System. At the beginning of 2022, the guidelines for the first theme: Inclusion and Diversity are expected to be published internally. Throughout 2022, other themes will be mapped and developed, with emphasis on Sustainable Finance and Purchasing. Access the Sustainability Policy https://www.sicredi.com.br/media/politica_de_ sistência.pdfPillars of sustainability: the incorporation of governance and consolidation of the ESG model Our sustainability strategy is based on expanding our positive impact in a balanced way between three pillars: Economic, Social and Environmental. In 2021, we incorporated another pillar into the strategy: Governance. It has the role of ensuring the balanced development of the other pillars, in addition to being in line with our cooperative business model. In this way, in addition to being signatories of the UN Global Compact, we follow the main trends global sustainability initiatives, which increasingly bring the ESG model (acronym in English for Environmental, Social and Governance) into the focus of the market and investors around the world. 37 Sicredi 36 Sustainability Report 2021 Role of leadership in governance and sustainability management GRI 102-20 Leadership Responsibility Chairman of the Board of Directors of SicrediParComply with, promote and encourage the application of the Sustainability Policy, through the adoption of its principles and guidelines and ensure compliance in decision making.

Sustainability drivers Our sustainability drivers and focal themes were developed to guide our sustainable development strategy, demonstrating in which themes we can, in fact, generate a positive impact and in which we must focus our efforts. In 2021, in the context of debates on the Sustainable Development Framework (learn more on page 41), which involved representatives of the System, sustainability experts and leaders, we reviewed these focal themes, facilitating their understanding. With this evolution, we now have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes.

They include topics such as eradicating poverty, combating climate change and preserving natural resources. GRI 102-12 In this way, we adopt these global agendas as guides for our sustainable development, at the same time that we align our business and position ourselves in a systemic way in relation to the topic. The Ten Principles and the SDGs are present in our Sustainability Policy, our Sustainability Strategy and the Sustainable Development Framework, permeating the implementation of the theme in all spheres of the business. In 2021, we offer courses in Global Compact on our internal education platform, Sicredi Aprendi, for all System employees. Furthermore, we started working on the Global Compact Action Platforms, as a way of leveraging discussions and actions on four fronts: • Action Platform for the SDGs • Action Platform for Sustainable Agro • Action Platform against Corruption • Climate Action Platform Our evolution in relation to compliance with the Principles and contribution to the SDGs is reported annually in our Sustainability Report and we will work from 2022 onwards to begin the process of building systemic sustainability objectives and targets for the entire System, connected to the SDGs. Sustainable Development Framework To connect all the points of our sustainability strategy and offer institutional guidance to support cooperatives in becoming protagonists in local and sustainable development, we created our Framework of Sustainable Development. In the following image, we show how the Reference works as a guiding thread, connecting all the components of this strategy (described in the previous chapters): Sicredi and The Smurfs: Together for sustainable development During Global Goals Week, which took place between September 17th and 26th, Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ launched a campaign to promote the SDGs among its audiences using the Smurfs characters, considered ambassadors of the SDGs and used globally to publicize the goals. The campaign was carried out in partnership with the ambassadors of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and included a series of videos that were made available on the project's official website and on the social networks of the Central's 31 cooperatives, reaching more than 4 million views. Access the campaign videos at: https://sicrediesmurfs.com.br/ Building a MORE PROSPEROUS society together Mission, Vision and Values Inspirational 2030 • PE 2023 Sustainability Policy | Guiding Guidelines Sustainability Strategy Focal Themes - InitiativesSustainability Drivers • Relationship and Cooperativism • Local Development • Responsible SolutionsPillars of Sustainability • Social • Economic • Environmental • Governance The Reference provides a set of initiatives that help us advance the agenda for sustainable development, both at the local and regional level, as systemic and brings a series of indicators that serve as the basis for Sicredi’s Positive Impact Measurement. Through them, we can measure our sustainability performance at the national, regional and local levels, and identify the points where we have opportunities for advancement. In 2021, we reviewed and validated the indicators that make up the Reference, with participation from all levels of the System. From this review, we established what would be the main indicators to be measured and evaluated to measure the impact we generate. During the National Sustainability Summit, an online tool (dashboard) was implemented to generate reports and monitor our performance. The tool will be made available for use in early 2022. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT BENCHMARK43 Sicredi 42 Sustainability Report 2021 Cooperatives can view the Benchmark in two ways: from an executive or managerial perspective. In vision executive, the executive indicators for each focal theme are presented. Furthermore, it includes business sustainability indicators, which are not linked to sustainability drivers but help us measure the strength of our business. This set of indicators will make up Sicredi's Positive Impact Measurement, which will be presented annually at the National Sustainability Summit. Through this analysis, cooperatives will be able to know how the its performance compared to the System and discover the main points of improvement, providing important material for analysis by local Sustainability Committees. From a managerial perspective, the Reference presents all the executive indicators and the middle indicators, allowing complete monitoring of its evolution on the path to sustainable development.

The implementation of the new regulations will be carried out in phases, starting in 2022. In line with the update of the regulatory framework aimed at managing social, environmental and climate risks and the social and environmental responsibility policy and climate, in 2021 we reviewed the Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy and, throughout 2022, we will also review the Sustainability Policy. As an example, we can mention the creation of Sustainability Guidelines based on the new Sustainability Policy, which will direct the role of centers and cooperatives in the various topics mapped, such as inclusion, diversity and sustainable finance. Still aligned with the BC# agenda and the new regulations, we will continue with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Framework as an instrument for measuring our sustainability performance. The Reference will provide input for monitoring and proposing actions by the Sustainability Committees, which are being implemented at all levels of the System, improving our governance and complying with the practices guided by the new regulations. 45 Sicredi 44 Sustainability Report 2021 INDICATORS BUSINESS SUSTAINMENT Executive indicators 2021 SustainmentNPS (percentage) 74.8% General principality (percentage) 33.87% Market Share of deposits in the coverage area (percentage) 3.19% Total net worth (billions) 24.9 Efficiency index adjusted to risk 0.65 Sicredi Combined financial performance (thousands of R$) 2019 2020 2021 Total assets 110,629,333 154,860,895 197,573,755 Assets Availability 1,272,645 1,258,087 1,443,685 Interfinancial applications. liquidity 7,281,251 13,044,514 33,716,227 Securities 25,062,076 38,410,830 22,513,768 Interfinancial relations. and interdependence. 4,052,357 4,364,055 5,809,721 General credit 40,216,998 56,885,229 76,316,232 Rural credit 26,111,885 33,068,493 46,702,898 Other credits 3,663,692 4,665,308 7 390,522 Other values ​​and assets 521,993 515,353 499,375 Permanent 2,446,436 2,649,026 3,181,327 LiabilitiesDeposits 70,758,342 104,638,994 129,536,750 Open market funding 2,194,884 2,343,109 3,257. 872 Obligations for loans and transfers 11,536,591 15,100,199 18,900,783 Other liabilities 8,381,275 12,220,917 20,665,534 Shareholders' equity and participation of non-controlling shareholders 17,75 8,241 20,557,676 25,212,816 ResultRevenue from financial intermediation 12,739. 750 12,663,110 16,959,589 Other operating income 3,041,353 3,669,354 4,401,690 Financial intermediation expenses 4,872,956 4,482,667 6,658,784 Other operating expenses 7. 8 03,715 8,470,768 9. 860,894 Results 3,104,432 3,379,030 4,841,601 Interest on equity 373,784 246,116 338,031National Financial Education Week ⁶ Impacted people (millions)74.4 4.4 19.0 Social 86 Local development 2019 2020 2021 Value generated Page Municipalities where we are present (quantity ) 1,378 1,463 1,600 Social 102 Municipalities with less than 100 thousand inhabitants (percentage) 87% 87% 86% Social 102 Municipalities where we are the only financial institution (quantity) 210 216 230 Social 102 Amount paid to suppliers local (R$ million)4550.50 576.18 850.7 Social 100 Result distributed to members (R$ million)81,044.00 990.00 1,191 Economic 100 Interest on capital paid to members (R$ million) 374.00 246 .00 338 Economic 100 Social Investment Value (R$ million) - - 158.8 Social 111 Systemic education programs (A União Faz a Vida Program and School Cooperatives Program) Participating municipalities (quantity) 47310551 554 Social 117 Participating schools (quantity ) 2,136102,786 2,789 Social 117 Participating educators (quantity) 9,4411023,314 34,953 Social 117 Participating children and adolescents (quantity) 118,15110287,198¹¹441,209 Social 17 Employee Confidence Index - - 88% Social 109 Actions carried out on Day C (quantity) 765 1,033 1,018 Social 118 1 The reduction in the number of participants in 2020 was due to the pandemic. 2 Indicator started to be monitored from 2019. 3 Indicator started to be monitored from 2020. 4 Methodology calculation was changed in 2019.

Focal Themes: »Spread cooperativism and sustainability »Promote inclusion and diversity »Strengthen our governance model Pillars: »Governance and SocialRelationship and Cooperativism02Related SDG Chapter:49 Relationship and Cooperativism 48 Sustainability Report 2021 Strengthen our governance model Member participation Our cooperative essence places the member at the center of our business. Core assemblies are the maximum moment of participation in our governance, when members take the lead and participate in the decisions that define the direction of the Cooperative. In the assemblies, the Members stay up to date with the main strategic themes of the year in the cooperative and their numbers, elect leaders for the next cycle, define how financial results will be distributed or invested, among other topics. The decisions of each nucleus are taken by the nucleus coordinators (delegates) to the General Assembly, which consolidates the results of the Nucleus Assemblies and deliberates on the future of the Cooperative. GRI 103-1 Fundação Sicredi is responsible for structure and provide solutions that facilitate this process and allow an increasing number of members to participate in the democratic process, with transparency and quality. Cooperatives are the entities responsible for conducting the decision-making process with their members, providing information and adequate access to events. The centers support the cooperatives in this process. GRI 103-2 To reinforce our alignment with the principle of democratic management, the Pertencer Program encourages the participation of members in assemblies and decision-making processes of cooperatives, including those related to their management and development. Through it, we establish the rules of participation, guide our participatory management model and engage members. GRI 103-2 The Pertencer Program management tool allows us to monitor assemblies from the creation of the event, registration of voting agendas, reception, and confirmation of presence of associates and measurement of data that make up our entire democratic management process within the cooperative’s social framework. SICREDI RC 12 In 2021, we included a course on Sicredi's Governance Model in the Basic Training of employees (mandatory training, of a regulatory nature). The course explains the basic principles and concepts of corporate governance. During the first half of 2021, the period in which the assemblies were held, we still experienced in Brazil a critical phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, which required social distancing in some regions. Due to the continued pandemic scenario, we had a decrease in the percentage of participating members. To continue the process, we leveraged the technological platform to hold digital assemblies, through which participants could attend their assembly, ask questions and interact with the cooperative through chat, have access to documents and materials presented and vote remotely.

Your objective The main goal is to promote the adoption of good management and governance practices. In 2021, several cooperatives from the System participated in the Program, among them, four cooperatives from Central Centro Norte were recognized with the SomosCoop Excellence in Management award, which demonstrates the search for continuous improvement in management and governance. PEG – Governance Excellence Program During the year, Central Centro Norte also worked to implement the Governance Excellence Program (PEG). The initiative aims to enhance the legacy built by our governance, in addition to bringing excellence to management and governance standards, considering internal and external benchmarks. The implementation of this program is based on three stages: • Creation and description of competencies for Counselors; • Carrying out assessments of Central Councilors and cooperatives; • Structuring the basic/continuing training journey for Counselors and Center Coordinators.51 Relationships and Cooperativism 50 Sustainability Report 2021 Ethics and combating corruption The principles of cooperativism determine our actions and support the sustainable growth of the business and the achievements achieved over time (check out the principles of cooperativism on page 16). GRI 102-16 These principles are described in the Code of Conduct, which guides our moral and ethical conduct. The document consists of a set of guidelines that guide actions and decisions made by all Sicredi members, regardless of their roles and responsibilities, in addition to internal and external relations. GRI 102-16 The Code presents the commitments to corporate governance, transparency, equity, accountability and responsibility necessary in the attitude of each of our employees. It also addresses the topic of sustainability, highlighting the preservation of the environment and the non-tolerance of slave and child labor and the corruption. GRI 102-16 The document, together with other internal regulations, also guides employees, business partners and members of senior management, including advisors, on how to avoid conflicts of interest and situations that involve the generation of benefits for any party. To prevent situations like these, our internal processes are defined with due segregation. GRI 102-25 All our employees undergo basic training at Sicredi Aprendi, our corporate learning system, in which we contemplate the content of the Code of Conduct. At the end of the training, each employee electronically records their knowledge and adoption of the principles stipulated in the document in their daily work. GRI 102-16In 2021, we launched the guide Tips for Conduct in Practice, which serves as support material for employees, complementing the Code of Conduct. The guide seeks to facilitate understanding of the topics covered, bringing examples that can be experienced by the employee. GRI 102-17 Also this year, we began the construction of our Anti-Corruption Policy, which considers the relevance of the topic in Brazil and our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (learn more on page 40). The Policy will still undergo final approval and will come into force in 2022. Complaints To meet demands regarding the Code of Conduct, we have made our reporting channel available reports, with options for recording doubts, compliments, complaints and suggestions related to the topic. The channel must be used to record situations with signs of illegality of any nature, and the user can choose whether to be identified or remain anonymous. GRI 102-17 The reporting channel can be accessed via the email address https://www.sicredi.com.br/html/ denuncia , or by calling 0800 646 2519 GRI 102-17 The Compliance team is responsible for management of reporting records, their monitoring, investigation and treatment until finalization, maintaining integrity, security and confidentiality. The area has independence, autonomy and direct access to the Executive Board of the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS) and other directors of the entities that make up the System. GRI 102-17Compliance To maintain our commitment to meeting legal and regulatory requirements, we seek to integrate this requirement into our business environment. business, promoting an organizational culture that values ​​ethics and integrity, aimed at preserving our image and reputation. With this objective, we have structured our Compliance area into three main work fronts: preventing and combating economic and financial crimes, official and external regulations and compliance governance. Furthermore, its performance follows the guidelines of the three pillars based within the Compliance Program: prevention, detection and correction. We are committed to complying with the international recommendations of the Financial Action Group against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (GAFI/FATF) and complying with current regulations, preventing our cooperatives from being used as a means of carrying out illicit activities. All cooperatives participate in monitoring to prevent crimes related to money laundering, concealment of assets, rights and values. GRI 205-1 When hiring of products and services, we adopt practices to inhibit misconduct, illicit acts or contraventions - to civil, environmental, tax, labor, relationship-obligatory legislation - as well as to anti-corruption and other standards, seeking to establish rules of direct and /or indirect from those involved. GRI 205-1 The movements carried out by associates are made available in daily routines and movements in cash exceeding R$50 thousand are made available per event, at any time, with a view to immediate communication to the Financial Activities Control Council (COAF). GRI 205-1In addition, we carry out monthly monitoring through a specific system integrated with our core systems, which cross-references records of financial transactions and the member's income or revenue. This procedure allows the identification of atypicalities, which are evaluated individually. GRI 205-1 The engagement of our employees employees on topics related to compliance takes place through training and regular awareness campaigns on ethics, risk management and the compliance program. GRI 102-17 Throughout the year, we carried out an internal communication campaign for integrated risk management with the theme “Be a Guardian of our business. Practice Risk Management.” The objective was to foster a risk culture among employees, covering all fronts: Brand, Risks financial and non-financial, Compliance, Security and Internal Audit, explaining the function, benefits, roles and responsibilities of each one. The initiative also complies with Article 8 of CMN Resolution 4557/2017, which highlights the obligation to disseminate Risk Management to all levels of the institution through a structured communication process. preventing and combating illicit acts, We keep training available on the Sicredi Aprendi regulatory training track that addresses anti-corruption and compliance issues. They are: • Code of Conduct: in a game format, real situations are worked on to enable practical understanding of the provisions of the Code of Conduct. The proposal is for the participant to know the Code of Conduct, follow Sicredi's value map and the set of guidelines, using the document as a reference for moral and ethics to guide your actions and decisions.

SICREDI RC13 Data protection We continue to implement the Program of Data Protection and Privacy, which seeks to comply with the General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD) based on integrated risk management. To reinforce our employees' understanding regarding data protection, in 2021 we launched the second series aimed at training regarding Pix and Open Finance, which addresses topics related to data security and associates' consent (learn more at page 108). * Percentage of employees who carry out training compared to the total for each functional level.55 Relationships and Cooperativism 54 Sustainability Report 2021 Spreading cooperativism and sustainability We believe that, by spreading cooperativism among associates, employees and communities, we increase the positive impact of our business. In this way, we reinforce the democratic, collaborative and transparent differential of our management model, strengthening the bonds of trust and reciprocity in society. GRI 103-1 / 103-2 Fundação Sicredi is responsible for developing systemic strategies for the topic. Cooperatives in their regional operations spread cooperativism and sustainability through their local initiatives and programs. GRI 103-2 The Crescer Program is our main cooperative education initiative and aims to expand understanding about cooperative societies, their functioning, benefits and differences in relation to other financial institutions.

GRI 102-13 We are also engaged in promoting cooperativism through participation in the Organization of Brazilian Cooperatives (OCB). GRI 102-13New space of the Sicredi Foundation In 2021, we inaugurated the new physical space of the Sicredi Foundation, which is located at the entrance of the Centro Administrativo Sicredi (CAS), in Porto Alegre (RS), and has a complete structure to present our history and the positive impact of our business. In it, we implemented the digital memorial, an open space for members and the community where we employ a series of multimedia tools to display videos, infographics and various materials about cooperativism and our own history. In the Foundation's space we also have the new Theodor Amstad Auditorium, with capacity for more than 40 people, in which there are presentations, meetings and events were held — always respecting health protocols during the pandemic. The new environment also provides the opportunity for the birth of new ideas for the development of our business, creating network actions to promote education, citizenship and cooperative culture. 57 Relationships and Cooperativism 56 Sustainability Report 2021 Sicredi Library At the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS), in Porto Alegre (RS), we have the Sicredi library, with a collection of more than 11 thousand specimens from different areas of knowledge, with emphasis on cooperativism.

Before this period, due to the coronavirus pandemic, coronavirus and the CAS resumption plan, we had no assistance or loans of new materials. For this reason, the number of loans made in 2021 is considerably lower compared to previous years. Woccu ​​Conference 2021 In July, we participated in another edition of the Woccu ​​World Conference (World Council of Credit Cooperatives, in the English translation of the acronym), the largest meeting in the segment in the world. Due to the pandemic, the event was held again virtually, bringing together representatives of credit unions from more than 50 countries to discuss initiatives that can improve people's lives. We highlight the discussions regarding the relationship between young people and the cooperative movement, through a panel that included the participation of Fundação Sicredi. Furthermore, 40 projects developed by members and collaborators were registered in the World Council Young Credit Union People (Wycup), a program that recognizes young leaders for significant contributions to their communities and credit unions. Five of them were awarded the award (find out more in Awards and Recognition, on page 24). By bringing knowledge about sustainability and its relationship with our business to employees, we put our sustainability strategy into practice. Through training on this theme, including basic training at Sicredi Aprendi, we support local implementation of our systemic initiatives and we empower cooperatives and centers to take a leading role in sustainable development. GRI 103-2 / 103-3 In addition, we rely on the training provided by the UN Global Compact Academy platform, on Sicredi Aprendi. The content was developed to contribute to the implementation of sustainability in the business strategy by promoting knowledge on the topic. With this objective, in 2022, we will deliver to cooperatives a complete training on the Sustainable Development Framework (learn more on page 41), which will contain a guide and a series of videos that will support cooperatives and centers in using the dashboard and measuring their positive impact.Sustainability training Total of trained employees 10,329 hours of training 4,861 Sustainability Committees To adapt the systemic sustainability strategy to the reality of each region, we have Sustainability Committees at the three levels of the System.

GRI 103-359 Relationships and Cooperativism 58 Sustainability Report 2021 National Sustainability Summit At a systemic level, we held the National Sustainability Summit, an event that aims to align the Sustainability Strategy at a national level. This year, with the central theme “Sicredi's Positive Impact”, the online event brought together more than 500 people, including managers, executives and professionals involved with the implementation of the theme in centers and cooperatives and featured sustainability specialist Sonia Favaretto – SDG as a speaker. Pioneer for the UN Global Compact and President of the Council GRI Brazil consultant. The event had three moments with different objectives and audiences. • Meeting of SicrediPar Advisors and Executive Directors of Centrals and CAS; • National Meeting of Sustainability Committees; • National Meeting for the Development of Cooperatives. During the event, relevant topics were discussed such as the Sustainable Development Framework, measurement of positive impact and the instrumentalization of Sustainability Committees, in addition to actions to recognition and engagement of employees who work directly with the topic of sustainability in their communities. Promote inclusion and diversity Diversity in governance The principle of cooperativism “Free and Voluntary Membership” highlights our openness to greater inclusion and diversity in the membership. In our daily lives, we seek to build an inclusive and diverse environment, with plurality of thought, collaboration and innovation, considering the needs and individuality of each person, continually expanding views and perspectives of diversity. GRI 103-1 In 2021, SicrediPar's Board of Directors defined that the position of Independent Director of SicrediPar would be occupied by a woman. We began the candidate selection process, which was completed with the inauguration of the future Board Member at SicrediPar's general meeting, in March 2022. In this way, we reinforced our positioning and materialized our actions for equity in governance. Furthermore, for the year 2022, we will make available the Sustainability Guidelines document for the topic of inclusion and diversity with the aim of guiding the actions of cooperatives throughout the System. GRI 103-2 Supported by the Sustainability Guidelines for the topic of Inclusion and Diversity, we are structuring the Inclusion and Diversity Committee, in order to execute our efforts with aligned objectives and practices, at all levels of the System.OUR ADVANCES IN DIVERSITY Greater representation of women in leadership Structuring of the Inclusion and Diversity Committee, scheduled for 2022Sustainability Guidelines for the topic of inclusion and diversity National Sustainability Summit 202161 Relationships and Cooperativism 60 Sustainability Report 2021 NUMBER OF COOPERATIVES WITH COMMITTEE WOMAN 333640 2019 2020 2021+12% Within the Inclusion and Diversity Strategy we are foreseeing the structuring and instrumentalization of Inclusion and Diversity Committees, which will be made available to cooperatives. These committees will have the role of advising the executive boards of Sicredi entities in implementing actions to execute the Inclusion and Diversity Strategy, at all levels of the business. The Committees will aim to address the topic of Inclusion and Diversity in the system and collaborate in the development of policies and practices designed to ensure the equality in labor relations, respect for human rights and incorporating Inclusion and Diversity into the business. We will also seek to offer institutional guidance to the Inclusion and Diversity Committees already started (in three entities), aiming to enhance the actions already carried out. In 2022, the R&D Committee's strategy will be deployed in the system's cooperatives. Through these actions, we promote the empowerment of women associated in the cooperative movement, expanding gender diversity in leadership and management positions in society and entities. In 2021, 37% of cooperatives had the Women's Committee. SICREDI RC18 / GRI 103-3 The systemic orientation is that the Board of Directors is the guardian of the initiative in cooperatives, with the president being its local sponsor. The program is divided into four levels: • Com itê Mulher – Agência; • With itê Mulher – Cooperativa; • Regional Women's Committees Summit; • Sum mit National Women’s Committees . At the end of 2021, we had 36.7% women in our membership, but only 24% of women are core coordinators. Among the Administration and Fiscal Councilors throughout the System, the percentage of women is 16%. SICREDI RC02The Youth Committee aims to encourage the development of young people through education and cooperativism, encouraging their engagement in the cooperative movement, making them social protagonists in the region where they live. In addition Furthermore, it has the important role of maintaining the longevity of our cooperative business, thinking about the training of our future leaders. GRI 103-3 The Program has a methodology developed for training members, with language aimed at audiences between 18 and 35 years old, carried out over 18 months. It includes a series of meetings and activities based on four perspectives: accessible language, content pills, real challenges and collaboration between members. Between the Themes explored are cooperativism and financial education, leadership and protagonism, exploration and prototyping, self-knowledge and purpose, sustainability and positive impact, entrepreneurship and innovation and volunteering.

The process of local articulation of your projects can be carried out by collaborators, core coordinators or community associates, who become the project's ambassador.NUMBER OF COOPERATIVES WITH YOUNG COMMITTEE 212623 2019 2020 2021-11% Women's Committee: Increasing the participation of women in leadership Cooperativa Sicredi Progresso, from Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ, is an example of how the implementation of a Women's Committee supports the increase in the representation of women in the governance of cooperatives. After the implementation of the local Committee, the Female presence among core coordinators grew from 22% to 40%, from 14% to 57% on the Board of Directors and from 17% to 50% on the Supervisory Board. In 2021, the program was partnered with Junior Achievement, through the JA Startup initiative, which supports participants in building projects with social impact for the communities where they live. To exchange knowledge between young people from different communities, we work with regional youth summits. Furthermore, young people Youth Committee participants are encouraged to submit their projects to the WYCUP Global Competition (learn more on page 56). In terms of age, 33.8% of our members are under 30 years old and 29.2% of our members are over 50 years old. In 2021, 21% of cooperatives had a Youth Committee.

GRI 103-1 Therefore, we seek to establish channels, physical and digital, to learn about your opinions, suggestions and complaints, in addition to understanding your needs, offering solutions financial institutions that add income and contribute to improving the quality of life, promoting the local economy and financial inclusion. GRI 103-2 The Relationship Policy with Associates, Customers and Users of Financial Products and Services establishes that relationships with associates must be based on the principles of cooperativism and our values, in line with regulatory and ethical determinations. It also reinforces the need to provide information in a clear and precise, in addition to meeting demands in a timely manner. GRI FS15 Throughout the year, we began updating the Policy, carried out controls and implemented processes with the aim of acting more deeply on financial inclusion, in addition to relating in a more transparent way, simplifying communication with this audience. GRI FS15 We work with greater attention to the needs of the most vulnerable associated audiences, which are all those who can find difficulties in using our services, such as people with physical or mental disabilities, the elderly, people living in more vulnerable communities and with little access to information. In this way, we seek to bring more transparency and simplicity in communications and use of our products and services, increasing the financial inclusion of our business. Policy management is the responsibility of the Ombudsman, an area also responsible for responding to complaints and demands. of associates and implement systemic improvements based on them. GRI FS15 In 2021, with the aim of being connected to the actions carried out in the branches, the area implemented the Ombudsman Focal Points Program in 100% of the cooperatives, and trained more than 200 employees on good customer service practices and the premises of the Relationship Policy . These employees are a point of contact between the Ombudsman's Office, located in the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS), and the cooperatives/ agencies, working more effectively to improve the member experience. Member satisfaction To monitor member satisfaction, we carried out several surveys. The metric used by the organization to measure the relationship experience with the brand is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). In 2021, from January to December, more than 173 thousand interviews were carried out with members of the individual, agribusiness and legal entity segments. Our NPS Relationship with the brand in 2021 closed at 74.79%, which represents a growth of 2 percentage points compared to the previous year. Our most satisfied segment are Individual members, representing an NPS of 76.85%. In all segments, the NPS showed positive evolution, with emphasis on the growth of the indicator in the Agribusiness segment, which increased by more than 3 percentage points compared to 2020. Through the Transactional NPS, we measure the experience member at specific points in our relationship, such as opening a current account. On this topic, our NPS closed 2021 in a zone of excellence, with an index of 85.73%. NPS Social identifies the perception that people have regarding Sicredi based on comments on social networks. Through the analysis of 7,700 interactions on our networks, carried out in December, we reached a satisfaction rate of 42%. Relationship channels We are committed to developing relationship channels connected to the evolution of our systems, mainly to the new platform that processes our financial solutions (new banking core). In this way, we seek to expand integration between all available channels, whether physical or digital, at the same time as we expand the offer of products and services and add new functionalities, such as mobility and omnichannel. In this context, the Sicredi application has become increasingly used. We recorded 3.3 billion transactions on the app, a volume higher than any other channel. It gained new features, such as the possibility for members to consult their PIX transactions over the last 180 days, the consultation and management of transactional limits via Pix and a new menu to consult home and automobile insurance already contracted. G4-FS14 For greater security and transparency, we have evolved biometrics for accessing the application. The user is warned more clearly that the Enabling biometrics allows access to your account using all biometric data registered on the device. We also implemented a control that requires entering a password when biometric data is changed on the device, for greater security when using the application. G4-FS14 Still focusing on transparency, we included the channel's privacy policy for members to access in the My Profile menu. G4-FS14 We also reactivated an important functionality of the application, the automatic activation of mobile token. 69 Responsible Solutions 68 Sustainability Report 2021 With this option, users no longer need to travel to a branch to activate the security device in the app, as long as some criteria are confirmed to guarantee the integrity of the account. G4-FS14 In internet banking, we offered the possibility of consulting Pix movements, including the display of future releases on some screens that did not yet have this option. G4-FS14 In addition, we provide members who use this channel with a hybrid bill, thus complementing the billing functionality. To facilitate adherence to the product, we use another improvement implemented this year in internet banking, digital membership. Through it, the member subscribes to the product or service of interest, without the need for in-person authentication or the use of an external digital certificate. G4-FS14 At the same time, we remain focused on advancing of our physical channels. We started using the Recycling ATM, which allows the public to make deposits without using an envelope and with credit to their account instantly. With this transaction available, members and non-members can make their deposits even outside branch opening hours. G4-FS14 In the second semester, we enabled the receipt of the new R$ 200 banknote at the Caixa Eletrônico Reciclador. By the end of December, the ATM park electronics Recyclers already had 85 pieces of equipment installed in its branches. We also make transactions available to account holders on our digital platforms. Service via Whatsapp In 2021, we began offering members the possibility of contacting their branch via Corporate Whatsapp. Service via application enabled agile service, providing practical access to services and information. New opportunities for people learn about the benefits that credit unions offer. Easy access to information about products and services available on the market. Integrates the BC# Agenda, of the Central Bank of Brazil, which aims to make the National Financial System more democratic and inclusive. Open Finance In 2021 we continued our process of implementing Open Finance, an initiative of the Central Bank of Brazil that seeks to create a financial system more open and transparent for customers and associates, through data sharing between financial institutions. We transitioned the name from “Open Banking” to “Open Finance”, with the aim of bringing to members the vision of a financial system that goes beyond a banking system. Throughout the year we implemented the initial phases of data sharing with the Central Bank, enabling the offering of products with better conditions for members. With the protection of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), Information will be shared securely and with the authorization of each member, and may be interrupted at any time. To prepare employees for this new moment in the National Financial System, we have made available a web series on Open Finance, on the internal Sicredi Aprendi platform, divided into chapters that are updated as the topic advances in the System. More than 12,000 collaborators accessed the web series. We also held live shows about the implementation of phase 2, with the participation of 3,459 employees. Still in the first half of the year, we began publishing information about our Accredited Agents on the Central Bank's open data portal, facilitating the search and identification by members and non-members of the locations where banking correspondents linked to Sicredi operate. G4-FS14 In the same delivery, we began to publish information about our branches in the withdrawal and deposit system without an envelope on the external network Withdrawal and Pague, which has more than 2,500 terminals installed in retail. G4-FS14 We also enabled notification of messages from INSS beneficiaries at the ATM, providing information on pending issues with the agency and facilitating communication with beneficiaries. And, still in the second half of the year, the Federal Servant Life Proof was enabled on the Caixa Eletrônico channel, now notifying the server that they need to provide proof with the agency. G4-FS14data portal open, such as address, opening days and hours, geolocation and available products and services. This delivery makes it easier to locate Sicredi service points for the market.

The Payment to Suppliers product had R$168.3 billion handled, representing an increase of 50% compared to the previous year. In relation to the Payroll Product, we recorded R$27.3 billion in transacted volume in 2021, representing an increase of 20% when compared to 2020. The representation of associates in the payroll reached 42%. We also present an 8% increase in the number of INSS beneficiaries who became members this last year. This audience represents more than 600 thousand members, contributing a contribution margin of R$641.4 million in 2021. In general, payment services to suppliers and private and government payrolls saw a 63% growth in volumes transacted in comparison to 2020. Pix In 2021, the Central Bank made important advances towards consolidation of the implementation of Instant Payments, with a focus both on new solutions and also on security and stability in the ecosystem that allowed the expansion of use. Brings in new associates, expanding our impact on communities. Reduces the circulation of money, contributing to greater physical security for members. Reduces costs for Legal Entity members, impacting the sale of their products and services. Increases the availability of solutions for members and, consequently, satisfaction.HOW PIX GENERATES VALUEIn December, one year after its launch, Pix already had a good following among our members, with more than R$180 billion transacted and 200 million transactions in the first 12 months of operation. The new payments arrangement is a strong ally in our objective of impacting communities, bringing more people into the cooperative world, making the population bankable and strengthening the local economy. Acceptance Acceptance allows associates to develop their business by offering digital payment solutions to their customers. They also help members centralize their financial flow in our cooperatives, facilitating the offer of our other solutions. Following the evolution of the payment method market in 2021, we implemented Pix acceptance in our card machines and were also pioneers in launching the solution that enables the use of Pix cell phone as a point of sale, with the functionality to receive payments.79 Responsible Solutions 78 Sustainability Report 2021 Green economy We know the power that our financial solutions have to support sustainable development and, therefore, we seek to identify opportunities for creation and improvement of solutions with a vision of sustainability, reinforcing our values ​​and positioning in the market. G4 FS7 / FS8 In this sense, we have a series of credit lines aligned to the so-called green economy, which focus on potential positive impacts for society and the environment, resulting in improved well-being of humanity and social equality, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcity. In 2021, we allocated R$24.6 billion in credit aimed at the green economy. To carry out a survey of which financial solutions fall within this line, we used as based on Febraban's green taxonomy methodology, which considers sector criteria and financing lines and programs with environmental and social benefits, allowing greater standardization in measurements of the national financial system. G4 FS7 / FS8 Throughout 2020, Febraban carried out a review of the parameters and guidelines of the green economy taxonomy in conjunction with specialized consultancy on the topic and the support of the financial institutions involved in the process. That way, In 2021 we also reviewed our internal methodology aimed at measuring this data. G4 FS7 / FS8 According to the new taxonomy, financial solutions were broken down into amounts granted to sectors with high and moderate environmental and social contributions and financing lines and programs with environmental and social benefits. In both calculations we consider the real effectiveness of the resource in enabling sustainable scenarios for our members. G4 FS7 / FS8 Bottom Sicredi Ações Sustentáveis ​​ESG In 2021, we launched Sicredi FIC Ações Sustentáveis ​​ESG, our first equity fund with an ESG (environmental, social and governance) focus, focused on companies, aligned with our sustainability strategy and that generate positive impact on society, in addition to profitability for the associate. Through active management of our Asset, the Investment Fund is made up of shares from B3 companies that are references in good social and environmental practices and governance and is available to members via the app or directly at branches. Companies eligible for the fund have initiatives and actions aimed at preserving and revitalizing the environment, with projects aimed at the transition to a low-carbon economy and renewable energy, in addition to considering fair commercial and labor relations. Find out more about the Fund at the link: https://www.sicredi.com.br/site/investimentos/fundos-investimentos/sicredi-acoes- sustainable-esg/ We facilitated more than R$1.05 billion in claims compensation, R$439 million in life insurance, R$188 million in car insurance and R$422 million in general insurance. Almost R$6.5 million was also paid to members drawn in Insurance products. In 2021, we implemented the Sicredi Claims Center, which operates 24 hours, 7 days a week, to file claims or assist members. The channel has an exclusive 0800 number, service on WhatsApp and a system available so that agencies and cooperatives can monitor claims. During this period, we have already made more than 100 thousand active and reactive calls and more than 20 thousand services via WhatsApp, with more than 8 thousand claims handled. Private Pension Through our pension products, we support members in their search for a financially stable future. At the end of 2021, we reached the mark of R$2.14 billion in reserves, an increase of 32% compared to 2020. With a focus on encouraging this growth and improving the member experience, we are structuring a new Private Pension self-service portal that should be launched in 2022. Among the main advantages of the new platform are an experience more autonomous for members, the simulation aimed at hiring and 24-hour service. Since 2020, we have adopted the processing of documents via email with the insurance company Icatu, replacing the traditional flow of sending physical documents. In 2021 we managed to evolve in this process and definitively adopted the flow via email. From this action, we reduced around 300 thousand impressions per year in the cooperatives, in addition to reducing the use of “Vai e Vem” plastics. In this way, in addition to minimizing the risk of document loss, we reduce the environmental impact of the operation. Investment funds Our members can diversify their investments through investment funds managed in our Asset or in carefully selected business partners. To recommend the most suitable products for your investor profile, we apply a questionnaire to understand your risk appetite. With the aim of democratizing and bringing investment to more people, some investment funds, depending on their profile, have the option of a minimum initial contribution starting at R$1.00. In 2021, we launched eight new investment funds, four of which are administered and managed by our Asset. We ended the year with more than 96 thousand shareholders in our investment funds, an increase of 41% compared to 2020. In relation to financial volume, in December we had more than 5.6 billion in funds, a growth of 19%, compared to the previous year.81 Responsible Solutions 80 Sustainability Report 2021 Sustainable finance In 2021, we structured the Structured Operations and Finance area Sustainable, with the aim of developing the theme within Sicredi and intensifying fundraising for credit aligned with our values ​​and sustainability strategy, through the issuance of bonds linked to social and environmental aspects. For 2022, we are developing a document with Sustainability Guidelines for the topic of Sustainable Finance. GRI 103-2 Throughout the year, we evolved in identifying socio-environmental opportunities in our portfolio, reinforcing processes, metrics and consolidating interactions with business partners. We have the support of technical assistance, in partnership with IDB Invest together with an international consultancy specializing in socio-environmental projects, to structure strategies and tools that can support the expansion of operations in sustainable finance, in line with market demands. . G4 FS5One of the highlights among the products aligned with the green economy is financing for solar energy, through which members can obtain credit to purchase equipment and technology to capture solar energy and generate clean electricity in their homes, businesses and rural properties. We had a relevant evolution in this portfolio in 2021, granting R$3.3 billion in credit, with 52.5 thousand operations, a growth of more than 90% compared to 2020. G4 FS7 / FS8 FINANCING FOR SOLAR ENERGY 11.73, 3 2019 2020 2021+ 94% PDI – Solar Energy Integrators Program The Solar Energy Integrators Development Program (PDI) is an initiative promoted, since 2019, by Sicredi Pioneira in partnership with Sebrae/RS and the University of Caxias do Sul (UCS) . The program aims to generate sustainable and perennial development of the solar energy chain through the qualification and professionalization of the cooperative's partner integrators and service providers. Furthermore, the program brings benefits for the development of the sector itself, with direct investment in participating companies that provide technology in the region. In total, there are already more than 500 approved partners. During 2021, more than R$150 million in new credits were granted and more than 3,100 new projects developed by the program.PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS (R$ THOUSANDS) 2019 2020 2021 Programs/lines of financing with socio-environmental benefits Female agriculture 16,405.3 18,242.3 17,538.3 Low Carbon Agriculture 38 8 ,707.9 4,078,888.8 6,694,551.8 Agroecology and Organic Agriculture 3,561.2 6,803.1 7.68 8 , 8 Good agricultural practices 5,384. 604.9 6,865,468.9 9,246,667.1 Renewable Energy and Environmental Sustainability1,077. 815 .1 2,356,126.5 4,531,130.8 Sectors with high and moderate environmental and social contributions High Contribution (Environmental) 82,552.6 118,490.0 194,802.6 High Contribution (Social + Environmental) 38,489.3 70,138.5 129,868.8 High Contribution (Social) 1,180,456.0 1,721,204.0 2,152,188.1 Moderate Contribution (environmental) 4 47,513.1 711.407, 8 1,088,020.1 Moderate Contribution (Social + Environmental 274.139,2 414.130 .9 492,423.9 Moderate Contribution (Social) 13,399.2 19,477.5 27,159.7 Total 8,907,644.0 16,380,378.3 24,582,040.1 *In 2021, we updated the names and sectors used for lines and programs and sectors following the taxonomic update carried out by Febraban and internal guidelines. survey of values ​​allocated to sectors with high and moderate environmental and social contributions, according to their degree of relevance, international references for the classification of sustainable activities were observed, such as the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) taxonomies, the European Union Taxonomy (EU) and the Social Bond Principles (SBP). Within the high sectoral contribution section, we have classified activities such as certified seed production, forestry planted and health and education services. In the moderate sectoral contribution section, we have activities such as waste management, material recovery and water treatment. G4 FS7 / FS8For the values ​​of financing lines/programs with environmental and social benefits, credit products and agricultural production systems identified with green characteristics were observed. We classify openings that can help in understanding some of the benefits most evident in our portfolio, very focused on the areas of agriculture and energy. For the next reports, we intend to evolve in the openings used in these surveys, combining measurements with Sicredi's sustainability and business development strategies. G4 FS7 / FS883 Responsible Solutions 82 Sustainability Report 2021 Promote financial education Our financial education initiatives expand the ability of cooperatives to have an impact positively our associates and the communities where we are present. GRI 103-1 Through them, we encourage conscious attitudes in the use of our products and services, offering guidance and advice so that people can make considered choices, aligned with their well-being, with autonomy, independence and planning. GRI 103-2 We thus encourage entrepreneurship and responsibility in business management and support small businesses in their process of establishing yourself in the market. GRI 103-2 Fundação Sicredi has an exclusive structure to conduct the topic, and is responsible for structuring, developing and implementing our financial education strategy. The centrals and cooperatives, through their cooperative development areas, are responsible for developing the Program and regional and local actions. GRI 103-2 In 2021, another stage of the Cooperation program in Ponta do Lápis was completed (phase 2), providing the opportunity for our centers and cooperatives to mobilize to develop - together with members, employees and communities - various financial education actions. In addition to the delivery of new materials (learn more on page 84), comic books were distributed and videos from Turma da Mônica were broadcast (as a result of the partnership with Mauricio de Sousa Produções), and other complementary content was also used. We promoted in total, including ENEF Week, 7,682 actions that together raised awareness of more than 19 million people among the different audiences covered by the Program. SICREDI SR 01732.7 thousand Turma da Mônica comic books distributed Around 19 million people impacted 7,682 Actions aimed at members and communities FINANCIAL EDUCATION ACTIONS Financial education action in online format. Fundraising for women entrepreneurs In addition to fundraising aimed at solar energy, we raised US$80 million (around R$438 million) allocated to finance micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. 2X Challenge – Finance for Women Through the partnership to finance micro, small and medium-sized companies led by women, we started to contribute to the 2X Challenge – Finance for Women. This is a global challenge launched by G7 development financial institutions that aims to allocate resources to generating entrepreneurship and leadership opportunities for women in emerging countries. O global challenge seeks to allocate more than US$15 billion in new financing to women entrepreneurs between 2021 and 2022. Raising for solar energy To meet the growing demand for credit for the installation of photovoltaic energy systems (solar energy), we signed a partnership agreement for funding with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to stimulate solar energy projects. The international line of credit is US$120 million (around R$600 million) and will finance solar energy projects for the institution's members throughout Brazil. This is the first operation of a Brazilian cooperative financial institution to receive certification issued by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), an international organization that works to promote investments in the low-carbon economy, establishing best practices for the market in terms of environmental integrity of products. of green economy. A The operation is also aligned with the Green Loan Principles (GLP), attesting that the projects offer clear and verifiable environmental benefits and that the evaluation and selection processes, as well as the management of resources and their monitoring, follow international standards. It is also the first IFC operation for a Brazilian institution with GLP certification. The agreement was signed with DEG, a German financial development institution, a subsidiary of the Development Bank German (KFW) and the French development agency PROPARCO, a subsidiary of the French Development Bank (AFD), both development financial institutions. In this case, it is a loan with a social bias, aimed at micro, small and medium-sized companies and including the gender factor as a criterion for the use of resources. The financing will be allocated to those companies with annual revenue of up to R$6 million and which have women as owners or partners holding more than 50% of the share capital. 85 Responsible Solutions 84 Sustainability Report 2021 Furthermore, we developed the COOPS Method, a financial transformation method connected to our cooperative essence. This is the financial transformation method of the Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis, designed with the participation of centrals and cooperatives, to help people with the step-by-step process for building sustainable financial habits. G4 FS16 Find out more about the Program Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis at the link: https://www.sicredi.com.br/site/napontadolapis/Conscientizar: content and examples for awareness;Observe: reflections to identify behaviors and motivations;Organize: exercises to strengthen good behaviors and correct the course of past actions;Prepare: definitions that guide plans and goals that improve financial life;Sustain: reinforcement for the adoption of healthy financial habits.C O O P S Journey of Financial Education in Schools In 2021, we launched the Journey of Financial Education in Schools, a complete training for teachers that encourages their autonomy to work on financial education in the classroom*, bringing an active and interdisciplinary pedagogical proposal that connects with the context and reality of each school community. Jornada has several original teaching materials, developed by specialists, and has advisors pedagogical partners of the cooperatives. These professionals are qualified by Sicredi to, together with the cooperative development teams, implement the Journey in schools and provide pedagogical support to educators throughout their training. *Financial education became mandatory in schools from 2020, in compliance with the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC, 2018) Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis is our systemic education program financial. Its purpose is to “cooperate towards a sustainable financial life” and plays the role of developing and strengthening the theme in our business and society. G4 FS16 Based on Economic Psychology and Behavioral Economics, it helps people to become aware of their relationship with money and to develop habits and attitudes that contribute to a sustainable financial life. GRI 103-2 PILLARS OF THE COOPERATION PROGRAM AT THE TIP OF THE PERMANENT PENCIL Application continuous action and always evolvingSYSTEM Collaborative construction so that it belongs to everyone INNOVATIVE Based on behavioral sciences In 2021, we built Phase 2 of the Program, in which we focused our efforts on three key audiences: Associates: we developed workshops that support behavior change through reflections, content pills and practical exercises. Employees: we built a workshop to raise awareness among our internal public, encouraging sharing stories and knowledge.Schools: we have created complete training for teachers, to support them in the task of developing financial education integrated into the school curriculum (learn more on the next page).87 Responsible Solutions 86 Sustainability Report 2021 We have a centralized structure of integrated risk management, which serves all entities linked to the System, from Banco Cooperativo Sicredi to central offices and cooperatives. GRI 103-1/ 102-15 Based on the lines of defense model, risk teams act independently from the business areas and internal audit, dedicated to identifying, controlling and mitigating factors that may compromise the sustainability of the business in the short, medium and long term, contributing to maintaining our strength and confidence. GRI 102-15 We consider in our risk management process: • Strategic risks; • Financial risks: -credit; -market; -liquidity; -capital management; -variation of interest rates for banking portfolio instruments (IRRBB); and -social and environmental; • Non-financial risks: -rational operation; -business continuity; -information security; and -compliance. Risks are assessed for each new action that could potentially increase its impact on our results, assets and liquidity, considering, whenever possible, stress scenarios and mitigating measures. Risk management Its management includes monitoring indicators and monthly reporting to the committees that support Sicredipar's Board of Directors in deliberations related to risk management policies and guidelines and the prudential limits to be observed. GRI 102-15 The Board has the support of the Risks and Compliance Committee to identify risks and opportunities related to the topics discussed. Thus, we guarantee the effectiveness of the process, acting in the evaluating the most comprehensive technical aspects of the risks and reporting or indicating actions to the Board for specific deliberations. GRI 102-15 Our policies and standards comply with legal requirements and market practices and are reviewed annually, with the aim of maintaining the consistency of guidelines, rules and procedures. GRI 102-15 The Risk Appetite Statement, or RAS, is a systemic document that aligns our appetite with different types of risks, defines alerts and limits, in addition to facilitating the dissemination of the risk management culture in the System. GRI 102-29 /102-30/ 102-31 Our appetite for risk is based on our strategic vision. All institutions that make up the System must follow the RAS and all actions contained in the strategic planning must be compatible with the risk appetite described in the document. GRI 102-29/ 102-30/ 102-31Ensuring integrated risk management National Financial Education Week (ENEF Week) We participated in the 8th edition of the National Financial Education Week (ENEF Week), an initiative of the Brazilian Financial Education Forum (FBEF). During the period, we intensified our actions focused on the topic across the country, seeking to expand the impact on people and communities. GRI 103-3 / G4 FS16 During this year's ENEF Week, we systematically promoted the live “Sustainable Financial Life”, in which we addressed the relationship of people with money, with practical tips on how behaviors can be developed that help achieve a more sustainable financial life. We also promoted the live “Turma da Mônica and Financial Education”, with the aim of encouraging a light and fun conversation about financial education with children. In total, we carried out 3,033 face-to-face and digital actions during ENEF Week, impacting around 19 million people. In addition, cooperatives were given the Action and Event Registration Tool, which is now used to record all financial education actions, whether they were carried out during ENEF Week or throughout the year. As a result, the registration of ENEF Week actions with Bacen began to be carried out by the Sicredi Foundation, which extracts the data from the new tool and then exports the data to the website https://weekenef.gov.br/. G4 FS16 ACTIONS OF THE WEEK ENEF 2019 2020 2021 Actions 5,574 1,408 3,033 Due to the coronavirus pandemic coronavirus, we had a considerable impact on our actions in 2020. This year, with the advancement of population vaccination and the easing of health restrictions, we once again intensified efforts in financial education actions, especially during ENEF Week.89 Responsible Solutions 88 Sustainability Report 2021 In conjunction with our Socio-Environmental Risk Management Standard, it establishes the guidelines and consolidates the rules applicable to associates whose activities have exposure to social, environmental or climate risks and relevant proportionality in our portfolio. G4 FS1 The procedures established in the documents guide the stages of the credit cycle, as well as the creation and maintenance of our financial services, and are guided by the principles established by the Central Bank. G4 FS1 In 2021, we once again had the opportunity to strengthen our relationship with bodies and institutions involved with the topic. Furthermore, we promote virtual meetings with teams from cooperatives and centers to clarify updates to the Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy and Standard, applicable regulations, risk management processes and good socio-environmental practices, market movements, Rural Environmental Registry and restricted areas, among others. G4 FS1 Demonstrating the increasing importance of the topic, we carried out several reports, technical discussions and cooperation agreements with business partners, such as IDB Invest, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) and the Société de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coopération Economique (PROPARCO ). In these dialogues, we share data, analysis and advances in socio-environmental risk management procedures, defining plans and actions to be carried out to improve processes related to the topic. G4 FS5 Agenda BC# - Sustainability Pillar: Throughout 2021, the Central Bank carried out three public consultations in order to understand how institutions deal with the issue of social, environmental and climate risk. As a result, in September it published a standard that amends resolution 4,557 and provides for the strengthening of the rules for managing these risks, including the standardization of disclosure, by financial institutions, of their information on the theme. Along with the standard, the Central Bank published its first Social, Environmental and Climate Risks and Opportunities Report, presenting actions in the sustainability dimension of the BC# Agenda, which brings together its strategy for promoting the country's financial stability. In 2021, We carried out an internal communication campaign for integrated risk management with the theme “Be a Guardian of our business. Practice Risk Management, find out more on page 51. Financial security Our Action takes place in an integrated manner, with cooperatives supporting each other. With this support network, we offer members a series of instruments that guarantee security and reliability for their investments. We rely on the Credit Cooperative Guarantee Fund (FGCoop), for example, with the aim of guaranteeing deposits and providing financial assistance to cooperative financial institutions with possible liquidity difficulties. We work with Sicredi Guarantee Funds, funds made up of contributions from our cooperatives, reimbursements and asset recovery, which have the function of guaranteeing compliance with financial obligations and supporting cooperative development actions. The security of members' investments is attested by the main credit risk rating agencies in the world, which guaranteed Sicredi the following ratings on a national scale: Social, environmental and climate risk Fitch Ratings: AA(bra) Moody's Local: AA+.br Standard & Poor's: brAAA Moody's: Ba2 Standard & Poor's: BB-Financing of activities in sectors exposed to social, environmental and climate impacts can generate financial losses and damages our reputation. Therefore, we have detailed mechanisms to mitigate the risks of these operations, as well as the specific assessment of their impacts on the business and the communities in which we operate. GRI 103-2 The strategy about The issue of socio-environmental risk is the responsibility of SicrediPar's Board of Directors and the structure for monitoring and adequate management of the topic, which supports all Sicredi entities, is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, subordinate to the Executive Risk Board. G4 FS2 The systemic management of the topic is the responsibility of the Credit and Socio-Environmental Risk Superintendence, which reports to the Executive Risk Directorate. In the central offices, the responsibility for the management of socio-environmental risks it is the Supervisory Board and in cooperatives it is the Operations Board. GRI 102-11 / 103-2 Our Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy complies with Resolutions 4,327 and 4,557, approved by the National Monetary Council and published by the Central Bank of Brazil, remaining the main driver of our socio-environmental management. The Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy is available to the public here: https://www.sicredi.com.br/site/sobre-nos/sistência/RATINGS NATIONAL SCALE RATINGS GLOBAL SCALE91 Responsible Solutions 90 2021 Sustainability Report Socio-environmental screening We evaluate the credit proposals requested and the areas to be benefited, if any , through documentation and elements that support our decision. G4 FS2 We systemically block products with greater exposure to socio-environmental risk for associates and their respective groups included in the official lists of environmental embargoes published by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (IBAMA) and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Preservation (ICMBio). G4 FS2 These cases are subjected to a specialized assessment, which can generate an opinion for the continuity of the credit granting flow in situations where the area to be benefited is not the location subject to the embargo and where socio-environmental risks are mitigated, observing the reservations and conditions deemed necessary. G4 FS2 In 2021, we carried out 704 screenings, 8.66% of which were carried out on legal entity (PJ) members. G4 FS10 The member remains blocked while on the official lists and this screening is carried out with each new request for a product with greater exposure to socio-environmental risk. G4 FS2 Geoprocessing We use geoprocessing systems to assess areas of greatest environmental risk in our rural credit operations, in line with the obligation to capture and send coordinates established by the Central Bank. G4 FS2 Based on the geodetic coordinates of the area to benefit from financing, as well as those accepted as collateral, we automatically validate whether there is an overlap with risk areas officially disclosed by the responsible environmental bodies. G4 FS2In this pre-grant validation, a “restriction” message is issued when overlaps with APAs (Areas of Environmental Preservation) and ARIEs (Areas of Relevant Ecological Interest), or a “prohibition” message when overlaps with indigenous lands, quilombola lands, embargoed areas or full-use conservation units are identified, preventing the continuity of financing in these cases. G4 FS2 Post-concession monitoring After the concession, the benefited areas continue to be monitored throughout the entire useful life of the operation, in order to verify their regularity. This initiative expanded the scope of our processes, establishing a new level of mitigation of socio-environmental risks, limiting damage and unwanted exposure in areas of greatest risk. G4 FS2 Monitoring risk appetite (RAS) and carrying out stress tests We establish metrics and monitor our credit portfolio, at a regional and systemic level, in order to monitor and limit our exposure to risks. Furthermore, we carry out tests of stress in which we simulate scenarios of exposure to different types of risks to understand how they interact with each other and can impact our main indicators. G4 FS2 Quantitative tools for managing portfolio risks In 2021, we made available to cooperatives quantitative management tools based on mechanisms that measure aspects related to the social, environmental and climate risks of the portfolio and counterparties, allowing their classification and analysis. In 2022, seeking to increasingly act across the entire risk management cycle Social, Environmental and Climate Risk Practices All of our credit, consortium and exchange contracts have a socio-environmental responsibility clause, with a provision for fines and early settlement of operations before non-compliance with contractual items that establish socio-environmental commitments. G4 FS3 The assessment of early settlement in cases of non-compliance is carried out by the Board of Directors of the respective cooperative, through monitoring provided by the centralized RSA management area. G4 FS3 We apply social, environmental and climate risk checks in accordance with the importance principles of our portfolio. To this end, services are segmented into certain levels of verification and analysis, according to their classification in relation to exposure to risks, seeking an effective coverage of operations. credit, consortium and foreign currency. G4 FS2 Financing activities in sectors most exposed to socio-environmental impacts, such as agriculture and livestock, require more detailed risk mitigation mechanisms. G4 FS2 Find out below about the social, environmental and climate risk practices adopted in our operation: Socio-environmental self-declaration questionnaires In our credit granting process, we apply self-declaration questionnaires to associates whose activities have greater exposure to risks and value, functioning as a flag of possible socio-environmental problems or irregularities. Through a qualitative evaluation of the questionnaire, it is used in decision-making regarding the member's credit operations. G4 FS2In line with the social, environmental and climate agenda, in 2021 we began implementing questionnaires for granting credit to individuals in agribusiness and legal entities in the health sector. Like this, Throughout the year, we had 41,516 questionnaires in force, of which 60.98% were applied to legal entity (PJ) members, a significantly higher number than the previous year. G4 FS10 Prohibited and not recommended activities We conduct monthly monitoring of compliance with the socio-environmental clauses of our contract based on official public information from our geoprocessed operations, in order to validate whether the area benefiting from financing remains in good standing. We also monitor associates with signs of exposure to socio-environmental risks, such as involvement in slave labor and environmental embargoes. G4 FS3 We conduct checks that seek to assess member involvement in non-recommended activities, such as the extraction or sale of wood from native forests, and monitor the behavior of the portfolio related to high exposure activities, such as coal mining. Furthermore, we verified the involvement of associated with prohibited activities, such as, for example, slave labor. We carried out a systemic blockade that prevents any granting of credit to individuals and legal entities and their respective economic groups registered in the register of employers who subjected workers to conditions similar to slavery, published by the Secretariat of Labor and Ministry of Economy.93 Responsible Solutions 92 Sustainability Report 2021 In the internal reinforcement of processes, trained around 1,693 multipliers in centers and cooperatives, with the aim of disseminating and improving the practices adopted. The centralized Socio-Environmental Risk management team intensified its specializations on the topic through courses, participation in lectures, congresses, forums, workshops and working groups with other financial institutions, aiming at qualification and exchange of experiences. G4 FS4 Climate risks The implications and risks in As a result of climate change, they are becoming increasingly important in the regulation and structuring of risk controls for financial institutions. In order to expand and integrate our assessments of these risks, in our new Sustainability Policy, we commit to following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). GRI 102-12 Throughout 2021, we continued to participate in the discussions of the Brazilian Federation working group of Banks (Febraban) aimed at supporting institutions on this topic. Among the techniques discussed at the forum and which are already being applied in internal surveys and analyses, is the green taxonomy, a standard sector classification technique that measures exposure to climate risks in our credit portfolio, based on TCFD recommendations. GRI 201-2 This sectoral exposure variable to climate risks is reported in our credit treadmill analysis report and is considered in the modeling of measuring the socio-environmental risk of our associates. GRI 201-2 Seeking to ensure legal certainty on the topic, we introduced the item climate change into our standard socio-environmental responsibility clause, highlighting the importance of adopting control practices and compliance with applicable legislation. GRI 201-2 In addition, we are developing a stress test to evaluate different climate risk scenarios for the institution, allowing a quantitative measurement of these implications and complementing that already applied to socio-environmental risk. GRI 201-2 In conjunction with the actions of the working group and the market, the evolution of impact controls due to climate change will be a priority on next year's agenda, assisting in compatible risk management and mitigation by Sicredi. GRI 201-2 socio-environmental, these topics will be treated as a priority in improving the identification of opportunities, impacts and risks for the System. G4 FS2 Interlocution with environmental agencies and business partners We expanded dialogue with environmental agencies through integration actions, aiming to disseminate regularization, awareness and risk mitigation practices. Likewise, we strengthen relationships with business partners, increasing dialogue regarding socio-environmental risk mitigation practices, monitoring data and evaluation methodologies. G4 FS2 We also participate in studies and development of a specific methodology for recording losses resulting from socio-environmental damages in the Febraban Working Group, allowing greater monitoring of the impacts of the topic on associates and operations. G4 FS2 Assessment of Socio-Environmental Risk procedures The implementation of these actions and their results are reported and discussed in the competent forums, including the Sustainability Committees, Risks and Compliance . The Technical Risk Committee evaluates and positions actions and the creation and maintenance of products regarding the topic of socio-environmental risk, supporting the strategic decisions established by SicrediPar's Board of Directors. G4 FS2 The Internal Audit area conducts the annual process of evaluating the effective adequacy of the procedures assumed in the regulations. In September, the internal audit work on RSA management was completed, based on the guidelines and rules established in the new Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy and the Socio-Environmental Risk Management Standard. G4 FS9 Since 2016, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), our business partner, has carried out annual supervision of the process through the Universal Banks Report and the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), through its Compliance Report, also carries out the annual monitoring of compliance with SARB14 self-regulation. In 2021, DEG Invest & Proparco conducted a due diligence process with Sicredi, in which our socio-environmental risk management practices were analyzed and approved, identifying opportunities for advancement to be made throughout 2022. G4 FS9 Still, since 2016 , the Central Bank of Brazil, annually evaluates the implementation of Resolution 4,327/14 and the application of socio-environmental practices through an electronic questionnaire. G4 FS9 Training in social risks, environmental and climate Through a series of training courses focused on social, environmental and climate risks, we promote the incorporation and constantly improve the criteria for managing socio-environmental risk. GRI 103-3 Among the training, we highlight the certification on Socio-Environmental Risks and Opportunities (distance mode), mandatory for all System employees, totaling 29,037 participants in 2021.

We annually prepare the Systemic GHG Emissions Inventory, which records representative emissions from all our cooperatives. Through it, we can develop initiatives to reduce and neutralize the impact of our operations. Our Inventory is calculated according to the GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol) methodology. In 2021, we renewed our membership in the Brazilian Program GHG Protocol and published, on the Public Emissions Registry Platform, our 2020 GHG Emissions Inventory, which was recognized with the Gold Seal, the highest level of qualification for corporate emissions inventories. GRI 102-12 Furthermore, in 2021, our cooperatives avoided the emission of 580 tCO2e through self-generation of solar energy. The initiative was reported by 144 units, including agencies and administrative headquarters. 1 The percentages were calculated based on the total of emissions following the purchase choice approach in Scope 2. Therefore, we do not report the percentages referring to Scope 2 according to the location approach. 2 Calculated following the energy purchasing choice approach. ³ The purchasing choice approach takes into account the purchase of renewable energy from the free market by the CAS headquarters. Promoting eco-efficient management We consider that eco-efficient management is one that seeks to achieve maximum efficiency in the use of resources — materials and natural materials —, with minimal adverse impact on the environment and generating a positive impact. GRI 103-1 /103-2 Our cooperatives develop local initiatives, such as branches and headquarters built with sustainability attributes, in addition to energy efficiency initiatives and self-generation projects for electricity from solar sources. In 2022, we will structure an Eco-efficiency Program , which will guide the topic in a systemic way, expanding the positive impact of initiatives. The management of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is carried out in a systemic manner, including a complete diagnosis of operations through the GHG Inventory and the annual neutralization of the total emissions calculated in the inventory. Photovoltaic Plant – Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo, headquartered in the city of Santa Cruz do Sul/RS and linked to Central Sicredi Sul/Southeast, invested in its own photovoltaic plant, generating 100% clean and renewable energy for the new administrative headquarters and for the 15 agencies of the Cooperative. Furthermore, the plant contributes to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with the purchase of energy from the Cooperative. With an investment of R$2.5 million, the photovoltaic generation complex consists of 1,238 modules and an installed power of 544,720 kWp. This energy generation capacity is sufficient to supply all Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo branches, with the exception of Vale Verde, which has its own photovoltaic energy microgeneration. 97 Responsible Solutions 96 Sustainability Report 2021 Working with suppliers and partners with sustainable management Engaging suppliers for Sustainability We seek to extend our concerns and advances regarding sustainability to the systemic supply chain, encouraging them to adopt the best social and environmental practices. GRI 103-1/ 103-2 Relationships with suppliers are guided by the Internal Standard of Corporate Purchasing. The guideline indicates that suppliers should preferably be associated with one of our cooperatives, in order to generate more value for our business chain. We also prioritize suppliers from the communities where we are present, as part of the strategy to contribute to local development. The purchasing standard guides the hiring and management of suppliers that will be used by the System. GRI 102-9 Our main suppliers deliver from corporate supplies to more complex service solutions, located throughout the national territory. The main suppliers responsible for threshold solutions to the process are based in the South, Southeast and North regions. GRI 102-9 In 2021, we hired 84.5 thousand suppliers, to which we paid a total of R$6.1 billion. GRI 103-3 / 102-9 Our purchasing decisions and contracting of goods and services must comply with the socio-environmental criteria defined in the Policy Sustainability, generating economic results (better cost-benefit) while respecting the environment and improving the quality of life of the people with whom they interact. GRI 102-9 To ensure that suppliers are aligned with our values, we include anti-corruption, human rights and environmental clauses in our contracts, addressing topics such as child and slave labor. We advise that cooperatives use these same standardized clauses in your local shopping. In this sense, of the 265 new suppliers hired in 2021, around 77.36% had sustainability clauses included in their contracts, committing to responsible action. GRI 103-3 / 308-1 / 308-2 / 414-1 We currently do not have a complete process for evaluating suppliers based on socio-environmental criteria, but we are progressing in the development of a third-party management project. Throughout 2021, we evaluated a flow of management in which we carry out assessments of suppliers based on compliance, credit, information security and socio-environmental criteria, among others, to mitigate risks in the operation. We are defining the process to understand which suppliers to apply the questionnaire to and how to monitor their actions GRI 102-10 / 308-2 With the implementation of this process, we will monitor partners periodically, as relevant, and create action plans when necessary. In 2021, the project was conducted in a pilot phase, with 10 suppliers considered relevant. GRI 308-2Neutralization In 2021, we neutralized the more than 21 thousand tons of GHG calculated in our 2020 Emissions Inventory. The neutralization of 100% of our emissions was done through support for five carbon credit projects, one in each region of Brazil. We seek to choose projects close to the communities where we operate, generating local sustainable development. SICREDI SR03 All projects They have a high standard of certification and include social, environmental and economic benefits, contributing to the development of regions. Furthermore, the chosen projects contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Composting Project: aimed at supporting 13 families of small rural pig producers in various locations in Santa Catarina, it includes carbon credits for composting pig farming waste. The initiative presents improvements in production processes, provides income diversification for local producers, protection of water and soil resources and new markets for organic compounds. Bandeirantes Landfill Project: works with the generation of renewable electrical energy through the collection of biogas from a landfill in the city of São Paulo, with a focus on improving air quality. Minimizes risks of groundwater contamination, enables the recovery of degraded land and generating employment and income for local communities. Agrocortex Project: in the states of Acre and Amazonas, it is aimed at carbon credits for forest conservation in the Amazon. It aims to conserve more than 186 thousand hectares of the Amazon biome, protect endangered species of fauna and flora, sustainable forest management, generate alternative sources of income for the local community and encourage non-timber forest product cooperatives. Buenos Aires Project: Located in the municipality of Buenos Aires, in Pernambuco, the project is aimed at replacing native firewood as fuel with renewable biomass, in a ceramics factory. The project generates investment in education for the local community, support for culture and leisure in the community and protection of the Caatinga Biome. Reunidas Project: in Cristalândia, in Tocantins, the project also replaces firewood as fuel with renewable biomass in a ceramics factory, protecting the Biome Thick. Among its benefits are improved working conditions and social inclusion through opportunities for the local community.

Our cooperatives promote the local economy by expanding access to financial services for the local population, supporting the development of micro, small and medium-sized businesses entrepreneurs, in addition to the distribution of results among associates. We also prioritize hiring local suppliers and encourage business among associates. GRI 103-1 / 102-16 From the second half of 2021, we began to carry out credit operations under the National Support Program for Micro and Small Businesses (Pronampe) on a permanent basis, aiming to support micro and small companies with capital turnover and growth of your business. This year, there were 28.0 thousand operations were contracted and we granted around R$1.8 billion. In 2021, we began operating an agreement with the Ministry of Health that seeks to facilitate access to credit based on receivables arising from services provided to the Unified Health System (SUS) by our associated medical clinics and hospitals. This is a long-standing demand from Cooperatives, especially those linked to the health segment. Initially, agreements were signed with Sicredi Campos Gerais and Sicredi Recife, and we are currently in the phase of obtaining the consignable margin for each member. In the future, it may be extended to other interested Cooperatives. In 2021, the total spent on local suppliers was R$850.7 million, representing 13.8% of our spending on suppliers in the year, an amount that directly feeds the local economy. This year, we adjusted the way we cross-reference data to calculate the indicator, which prevents comparisons with previous years. According to the new criteria, to define whether the supplier is local, it must be MEI or Simples Nacional and be located in a city covered by one of our cooperatives.

We also continue to evolve the marketplace theme. Over the past few years, the Sicredi Conecta app has allowed us to support the local economy, enabling new businesses and adding income and development to communities. In order to further advance the topic, the application was discontinued in September 2021 and will give way to new solutions to offer better experiences, convenience and new opportunities to members. Our cooperatives also promote the economy of the communities by allocating part of the results obtained during the year. In the assemblies that took place in 2021, we defined the distribution of results for the year 2020. GRI 103-2 In 2021, R$853 million was distributed to members based on the assembly's decision, representing 83.1% of the total of R$1,191 million. GRI 103-3 SICREDI DL02I cooperate with the local economy Through the I Cooperate with the Local Economy movement, we bring together civil society, local entities, press vehicles and public authorities to strengthen small traders and invite people to consume locally, making the economy spin. We believe that cooperating with the local economy yields a better world. The growth of the regions is one of our commitments. As a cooperative financial institution, we reinvest resources in the form of credit for members, entrepreneurs, rural producers and social projects. The I Cooperate with the Local Economy initiative reinforces this, supporting people and generating a positive impact in the regions. 103 Local development 102 Sustainability Report 2021 Promote financial inclusion Our System is made up of a network of cooperatives present in all regions of the country, from large metropolises to small and rural municipalities. We operate in cities where other financial institutions are not usually present, bringing financial inclusion to a population that would otherwise not have access to these services locally. GRI 103-2 We thus promote the financial inclusion of individuals and legal entities, integrating them into the financial system and providing broad access to financial and non-financial solutions. In this way, we guarantee the economic participation of members, adding income and contributing to improving their quality of life. GRI 103-2 In 2021, we had cooperatives in 230 municipalities where we were the only financial institution1 with a physical presence. Of these, 69% are located in the southern region of the country. Our presence generates a positive impact in these places, in addition to promoting the local economy. MUNICIPALITIES WHERE WE ARE ONLY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PRESENT GR 103-3 / SICREDI DL 01 Number of inhabitants 2019 2020 2021 Up to 5 thousand 158 162 167 From 5 to 20 thousand 52 54 63 Total 210 216 230 Around 6.7% of our branches are in municipalities classified as needy. According to our partner, Geofusion, municipalities with this characteristic are small, have a greater share of agriculture and public administration in the economy, are more dependent on government transfers and have the worst social indicators, such as the Human Development Index (HDI).

In 2021, Woop Sicredi users were able to make their payments via Google Pay, a digital wallet platform and contactless payment system. Understanding our local impact Due to our cooperative model and operations local, the money raised in a community is reverted into credit granted to other members in the same locality, generating a virtuous cycle of prosperity, which stimulates investment in the cooperative, generates income for the member and strengthens the local economy. We know that, by being present in less populated, more rural and more isolated locations, we take our products and services to a population of small rural producers and micro and small entrepreneurs who, otherwise would not have access to credit and other financial services. To understand and measure how we generate value in the locations where we are present, we carried out a series of studies to understand the penetration and generation of value of credit cooperatives. In 2021, we carried out the third study in the series “Benefits of Credit Cooperatives”, which evaluates the performance of different banking institutions in the country. GRI 203-2The study shows that credit unions have an important role to provide access to complete financial services to the population of municipalities that are considered less attractive for maintaining branches of traditional financial institutions. GRI 203-2 To reach the conclusions of the study, we created unprecedented analytical indicators: the Banking Presence Index (IPB), which reflects the probability of having a branch in a given city, and the Municipal Banking Indices (IMB) that evaluate the model institutions' business financial. The Municipal Relative Banking Index (IMB-R) measures how much its business model is concentrated in municipalities that are difficult to maintain and the Municipal Absolute Banking Index (IMB-A) reflects its performance in expanding the Brazilian banking service frontier. GRI 203-2 The results showed that the cooperative service network has a higher IMB-R and IMB-A than other institutions, that is, it is present in places where banking is more difficult, including a population that, in other cases, would not have access to financial services. GRI 203-2 * The calculation includes bank branches and cooperative service points.105 Local development 104 Sustainability Report 2021 Promote the development of people We positively impact communities by investing in the education and training of our employees, associates and communities. This is especially relevant in the case of employees, as they are, at the same time, residents of the communities where we operate and, members of cooperatives, are therefore also owners of the business, and responsible for our close and human relationships. GRI 103-1 By investing in its development and learning, we strengthen local development both by improving our ability to meet local demands and by strengthening the region's human capital. In this way, we also create an internal environment of innovation and learning for people to grow. GRI 103-2/ GRI 103-3 We are in the process of redesigning our corporate education strategy, to consolidate the systemic positioning of corporate learning, enhancing local and specific initiatives for each entity. Therefore, we seek to provide a better learning experience for employees, aiming to accelerate the business strategy and the Inspirational 2030 vision, through continuous, scalable and relevant learning. Agile Accelerator and Inclusive We are supporters of the Agile and Inclusive Accelerators, initiatives carried out for over 10 years by the consultancy Thoughtworks and PUCRS, which aim to put university-company relationship concepts into practice to foster innovation and developments aligned with social impact. Aceleradora Ágil was created with the aim of teaching the first steps in agile methodologies and programming to young people from vulnerable social groups. The Inclusive Accelerator was born as a development of this, seeking to accelerate the process of inclusion of more vulnerable social groups in the technology market. Currently, the initiatives operate through mentoring and lectures, offering high school and university students development programs in the area of ​​technology, with the opportunity to learn about programming, experience design, usability testing, among others.

They are fundamental to connecting us to our purpose and showing that change is necessary, while maintaining our cooperative essence. Two of these competencies were indicated as core for the entire System, they are: “Cooperative essence” and “Understand to serve”. The remaining competencies are free for each cooperative to choose. SICREDI-RC09107 Local development 106 Sustainability Report 2021 In 2021, we continued the Conecta&Desenvolve Program, which aims to contribute to the development of our skills and support employees in their development. The Program, which ended in 2021, took place collaboratively with cooperatives, centers and CAS, who sponsored the skills of their choice, and through monthly live sessions they addressed success stories, sharing tips on how to put them into practice in your daily life. GRI 404-2 The lives sensitized employees with content and approaches capable of generating new insights, new connections, reflections and changes in behavior. In 2021, 14 lives were held with more than 5,000 participants. A success built by many hands from many stories and countless experiences. GRI 404-2 In addition, the topic is also covered in our integration program Jeito Sicredi de Being, which presents our essence, values ​​and purpose to new employees. The program aims to offer a new experience to employees in the initial stage of their integration, bringing our essential skills and connecting the new employee to our culture. GRI 404-2 Annually, all hired employees go through the performance evaluation process, in order to guide career development by identifying strengths and opportunities of improvement. All entities that have already implemented the new Performance Management model carry out performance evaluation following the new competencies. In 2021, employees hired until the month of October underwent a performance assessment, totaling 78.2% of our workforce. GRI 404-3Corporate Learning Amid the constant digital and behavioral transformations we are experiencing, we find learning a way to become an organization where employees learn all the time and adapt quickly to new contexts. To support this scenario, our corporate learning process guides and supports the continuous development of our employees, promoting the training of professionals integrated into the cooperative culture. We currently have 2456 online courses and 1422 web conference classes, available for training our employees, with an investment of around R$ 27.1 millions. In 2021, 33,777 employees completed our training, averaging 30 hours each. GRI 404-1/ SICREDI DL13 /DL14 / DL 15/ DL17 One of the ways we conduct the employee learning process is to make content available in online formats, through the Sicredi Aprendi platform, for free access by employees.

We also have ongoing actions, which include internal and external courses and programs, seminars, congresses and specialization assistance, aiming to expand knowledge regarding processes, methods and techniques used by the market, related to the employee's current position or with a view to growth. professional. Managers have leadership training, connected to the current challenges of business transformation, which reinforces their management responsibilities and their role at Sicredi, enabling them to act strategically with a focus on people, processes and results.109 Local development 108 Report of Sustainability 2021 In 2021, to support our team in understanding and adapting to the digital transformation process we are experiencing, we made available on Sicredi Learn fifteen completely revitalized courses, enabling employees on the front line of customer service and those involved in change to be more prepared to serve our members. In total, over 14,254 employees accessed the training. GRI 404-2 In addition, we launched four more repertoire tracks with themes focused on transformation, made up of free, practical and quick courses, which promote learning in a simple and agile way, with the aim of inspire change in the employee's daily life, in a light and relaxed way. GRI 404-2 Still in the context of transformation, we held the Journey of Change Agents, which aims to level knowledge about change management and the performance of change agents at centers and cooperatives. This year the Journey was held with Central PR/SP/RJ, impacting around 70 employees who work directly in the transformation. GRI 404-2 During the year, we launched the second learning series about Pix, content consisting of several short videos, infographics, lives and guides to support employees in integrating products and generating new business. Around 2,100 employees took part in the training. GRI 404-2 Among the main initiatives for the development of our employees carried out in 2021 are: Investment Journey Aimed at professionals who sell investment products. Addresses the certifications, basic concepts of financial education, technical investment knowledge and our product portfolio. It is a live training, where the employee frequently encounters new content. GRI 404-2 Agency Training In 2021, we launched a new module for Agency Training – Business: @acontecenaagência, a five-episode web series that covers tips to support the day-to-day lives of our employees in serving members. The formation presents introductory and fundamental concepts for employees who work in our agencies. GRI 404-2 Welcome Manager We revitalized the Welcome Manager Track, creating a learning experience for our leaders, more modern and connected with the current challenges of transforming our business. Among the new features of the track in 2021 is the new module on career dialogues, in which the leader will go through a learning journey for a contemporary career. GRI 404-2 During the year we carried out a survey on the opinion of cooperatives regarding the quality of content available on the Sicredi Aprendi platform. As a result, 90% of respondents stated that they meet their learning needs. GRI 404-2Employee satisfaction This year, our Climate Survey began to be carried out within the Great Place to Work (GPTW) methodology, due to its relevance and compatibility with the market. With it, we were able to have a more accurate perception of the quality of our work environment and knowing the level of employee engagement with our values ​​and purpose. As a result, the survey showed a confidence level of 88% among our employees. More than 25 thousand employees responded to the survey, contributing to their perception of our practices. By adopting the methodology, we became a company certified by GPTW, being able to participate, from 2022, in the ranking that lists the best companies to work for in Brazil. 111 Local development 110 Sustainability Report 2021 Contributing to the development of communities The positive impact on communities is a natural consequence of our business model. Aiming to further expand our capacity to generate value, we have developed a series of systemic or local social investment actions, which are aligned with the principles and values ​​of cooperativism. GRI 103-1 / 103-2 These initiatives take local needs into account and generate bonds of trust, which strengthen the community, associates and, consequently, our business. GRI 103-2 Sicredi Platform in the Community The Sicredi platform in the Community, originally conceived in Central Centro Norte, aims to be a social investment hub, which connects people and initiatives to make a difference in the locations where we operate. It is a completely digital space with tools and environments that will connect the following social actions: • Social Fund • Sponsorships • Courses • Donations • Incentive Laws • Volunteering Integrating the Sicredi learning ecosystem, we will make several courses available on the platform for the community, with the purpose of promoting knowledge of cooperativism, financial education and sustainability, among other topics. Sicredi na Comunidade will be our relationship platform with the Community, through which We will seek to further materialize the positive impact on our associates and locations where we are present. Currently, we have already implemented Social Fund and Sponsorship initiatives, and the next initiatives to be added will be Courses (EAD), Fundraising – Donations, Incentive Laws and Volunteering. Through this space, we will enhance the connection between associates, communities and our initiatives. The platform’s conceptual phrase —“Cooperation that connect, grow” — demonstrates that the platform connects people and initiatives to make a difference, connecting those who can donate with those in need. For more information, visit: https://www.sicredi.com.br/nacomunidade/Investimento Social FATES From the Technical, Educational and Social Assistance Fund (FATES) we strengthen the principles of cooperativism, offering resources to assist members , their family members, and, when provided for in the bylaws, employees. To the cooperatives reserve at least 5% of their financial result for FATES. GRI 103-3Based on the Sicredi Social Investment (ISS) indicator, we calculate the total value of resources invested in social, environmental, cultural, educational and scientific actions in the System. In 2021, R$158.8 million was invested in actions through FATES, the Social Fund, donations and incentive law. SICREDI DL07 113 Local development 112 Sustainability Report 2021 Social Fund Making a difference in communities in which we are present, combining economic development and social transformation is one of the main differentiators of cooperativism. This is what we call interest in the community. And it is through the Social Fund that we transform efforts into a better world for thousands of people. With the Social Fund, cooperatives allocate a percentage of the previous year's results to support initiatives promoted by private, non-profit and legally binding entities. constituted. The supported actions must be measurable in effort, time and impact on social development. In 2021, R$30.7 million was invested in 3,287 social projects of collective interest in education, culture, sport, health, safety, environment and social inclusion. Thus, we contribute to the development of the regions where we operate.

The practice is aligned with the principles of cooperativism, such as voluntary and free membership, intercooperation and interest in the community. GRI 103-3 The Volunteer Movement is part of our social responsibility strategy and includes the principles, policies and strategies that guide volunteer actions in a more responsible way, which effectively serves the needs of the community. GRI 103-3 Volunteers participate in various actions such as Cooperate Day (Day C), the A União Faz a Vida Program and the Cooperation in Ponta do Lápis Program, among other local programs developed by the cooperatives themselves in their regions. Project Aí Chegou With the aim of transforming the needs and opportunities in its region of operation, the Cooperativa Sicredi Pernambucred, from Central Sicredi Norte/Nordeste, and the Instituto Periferia e Cidadania, with the support of Sescoop/PE, they created the Aí Chegou Project, which supports young people from the local community by delivering bicycle kits to make deliveries to commercial establishments in the region. The initiative seeks to provide job generation, income and citizenship for young people from the communities of Roda de Fogo, Torrões and Engenho do Meio, in Recife (PE), through cooperation between commercial establishments and young delivery drivers from the local community. Incentive laws We consider the laws incentive is an important way of contributing to local development. Thus, we have another possibility of expanding our social impact in communities where we are present through the allocation of resources, which can be deducted from the income tax due. In 2021, we allocated a total of R$1.04 million through Federal Tax Incentive Laws. This value represents the impact we generate in more than 38 municipalities, distributed across 8 states, benefiting 38 projects/funds. • Culture Incentive Law; • Sports Incentive Law; • Pr onon — National Cancer Care Support Program; • Pr onas — National Program to Support Health Care for People with Disabilities; • Municipal Elderly Fund; • Municipal Fund for Children and Adolescents.117 Local development 116 Sustainability Report 2021 The União Faz a Vida Program is our main education initiative. With the aim of forming citizens cooperatives in the communities where we operate, we encourage children and adolescents to be protagonists, think critically, make decisions and build projects collectively, developing the principles of cooperation and citizenship. GRI 103-3 + 3.7 million children and adolescents impacted + 180 thousand educators involved + 2,600 participating schools + 520 municipalities in 11 Brazilian states RESULT OF OUR ACTION IN 26 YEARS: The Program is based on its own teaching methodology, which values ​​knowledge obtained outside and inside school. In this methodology, which can be applied in Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education and High School, students are protagonists of the learning process and develop projects that help to work on globalized knowledge. For the Program to be developed, it is necessary to bring together the desire and action of the various agents, which is why we have a Commitment network made up of several public.C-Day Every year, in the month of July, we celebrate C-Day (Cooperate Day), a national initiative organized by the OCB System (Organization of Brazilian Cooperatives) that demonstrates the strength of cooperativism in favor of social transformations. On that day, participating organizations carry out, through volunteering, social responsibility actions in the communities, aligned with the principles of cooperativism. GRI 103-3 In 2021, the initiative had the motto “Come Transform”, and we carried out a national campaign to collect money and non-perishable food, which was targeted at people experiencing food insecurity. The campaign mobilized more than 3,800 donors in 330 municipalities and collected more than 1,200 tons of food, in addition to R$ 427 thousand that were raised through donations of values, which directly benefited more than 400 thousand people.

The objective is to support strategies for conducting the Program in the municipalities where it operates, in order to guarantee its sustainability and expansion. All training took place online, with more than 600 participants and 220 hours of course, based on group dialogues and collective constructions. Historical rescue We celebrated 25 years of the A União Faz a Vida Program in 2020, and to remember our history, we structured a documentary written with excerpts and testimonials from people who were part of this journey. Find out more at https://auniaofazavida.com.br/o-programa/historico.html In 2020, when the A União Faz a Vida Program completed 25 years, we carried out a study to evaluate its social impact. The results showed that the Program's positive impacts last in the lives of participants for a period of five to seven years, and correspond to four times the investment made. In other words, for every R$1.00 invested, generated R$4.07 in social impacts. Currently, 65 cooperatives develop the A União Faz a Vida Program, representing 60.2% of the total number of cooperatives affiliated to the System.

The account was closed, as authorized by court. The action was judged partially valid in a ruling for the purpose of authorizing the closure of the account upon prior notification with period of 60 days. The sentence was maintained until a final decision by the Superior Court of Justice. Due to the lack of appeal by COINBR, this decision became final, definitively closing the process on 02/07/2022.

One refers to Equalized Rural Savings (funding: PRONAF, PRONAMP and Others Producers; investment: PRONAMP), with a fine of R$ 1,259.61. Agricultural funding was identified, under no. B90820656-7, with overlapping of the benefited area with indigenous land. Received Letter 34074 from Bacen, pointing out the lack of payment of economic subsidies to the National Treasury. On 02/22/2021, the Bank's rural credit area carried out the return procedures to the national Treasury with a debit entry from the Cooperative. And another case regarding Targeted Credit: FCO (Rural, Tourism, Industrial and Services), with a fine of R$ 10,239.80. We received an award for a rural property, which had a pigsty with an open waste tank. Environmental surveillance visited the property and requested its closure. The agency hired a company to carry out proper treatment of the waste. However, she only closed it and the reservoir burst and the waste fell into a nearby river. The environmental police called the MPF. The Cooperative reached a legal agreement, agreeing to pay 24 thousand, this amount being the second installment.

To the Administrators and Associates of the Cooperative Credit System - Sicredi Porto Alegre – RS INTRODUCTION We were hired by the administration of the Cooperative Credit System - Sicredi (“Sicredi”) to present our limited assurance report on the indicators contained in the Annual Sustainability Report, based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), Standards version, relating to the year ended December 31, 2021 (“Report”). Responsibilities of Sicredi's administration Sicredi's administration is responsible for preparing and presenting appropriately of the information contained in the Report in accordance with GRI criteria, assumptions and methodologies (“Essential” reporting option), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of this information free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error . RESPONSIBILITY OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the information contained in the Report, based on limited assurance work conducted in accordance with Ibracon (CT) Technical Announcement № 07/2012, approved by the Federal Accounting Council and prepared based on NBC TO 3000 (Assurance Works Other than Audit and Review), issued by the Federal Accounting Council Accounting – CFC, which is equivalent to the international standard ISAE 3000, issued by the International Federation of Accountants, applicable to non-historical information. These standards require compliance with ethical requirements, including independence requirements and that the work is carried out with the objective of obtaining limited assurance that the indicators contained in the Report are free from material distortions. Limited assurance work conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) consists mainly of inquiries to management and other Sicredi professionals who were involved in preparing the information contained in the Report through the application of analytical procedures to obtain evidence that allows us to conclude in the form of limited assurance about the Report's indicators. A limited assurance work also requires the execution of additional procedures, when the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead him to believe that the information contained in the Report may present material distortions. The procedures selected were based on our understanding of aspects relating to the compilation and presentation of information contained in the Report in accordance with Sicredi's own criteria, assumptions and methodologies. The procedures included: a. planning the work, considering the relevance, the volume of quantitative and qualitative information and the internal controls that served as the basis for preparing the information contained in the Report; B. (b) understanding the calculation methodology and procedures for preparing and compiling the Report through interviews with the managers responsible for preparing the information; w. application of analytical procedures and sample verification of certain evidence that supports the data used to prepare the Report; d. comparison of data of a financial nature with the financial statements and/or accounting records The limited assurance work also included adherence to the guidelines of the structure for preparing the GRI indicators - Standards, applicable in preparing the information contained in the Report. We understand that the evidence obtained in our work was sufficient and appropriate to support our limited conclusion. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS The procedures applied in a limited assurance engagement are substantially less extensive than those applied in an assurance engagement that aims to issue an opinion on the information contained in the Report. Consequently, no enable us to obtain assurance that we are aware of all matters that would be identified in an assurance engagement that aims to issue an opinion. If we had carried out work with the aim of issuing an opinion, we could have identified other issues or possible distortions in the information contained in the Report. Therefore, we do not express an opinion on this information. Additionally, Sicredi's internal controls did not part of our limited assurance scope. Non-financial data is subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given the nature and diversity of methods used to determine, calculate or estimate such data. Qualitative interpretations of materiality, relevance and accuracy of data are subject to individual assumptions and judgments. Additionally, we did not carry out any work on data reported for previous periods, nor on in relation to future projections and goals.147 Annexes 146 Sustainability Report 2021 Credits General Coordination Fundação Sicredi Communication Coordination Superintendence of Brand, Communication and Segments Data source Sicredi GRI Consulting, Editorial Coordination and Project Management Ricca Sustainability Review Ricca Sustainability Graphic design and Layout Ricca Sustainability Photos Marco Photographer João Alves Bruna Scheidt Clarissa Londero For this report, photographic production was carried out respecting all safety protocols recommended to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

Non-financial data is subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given the nature and diversity of the methods used to determine, calculate or estimate these data. Qualitative interpretations of materiality, relevance and accuracy of data are subject to individual assumptions and judgments. Additionally, we did not carry out any work on data reported for previous periods, nor in relation to future projections and goals. Conclusion Based on the procedures carried out, described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the GRI indicators contained in the Sicredi Annual Sustainability Report, for the year ended December 31, 2021, have not been prepared, in all relevant aspects, in accordance with the criteria, assumptions and methodologies for preparing the indicators of the Global Reporting Initiative - Standards ( “Essential” reporting option).
