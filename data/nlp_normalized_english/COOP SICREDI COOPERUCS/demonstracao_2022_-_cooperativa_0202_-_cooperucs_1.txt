In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended on that date. , according to accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the principles relevant ethical standards provided for in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprise the Administration Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. 2 EY Building a better working world In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to review the management report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with practices accounting standards adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, the matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but it is not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: - We identify and We assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations. 2 EY Building a better working world - We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. - We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. O We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity . If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include change our opinion if disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. - We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events of manner compatible with the objective of adequate presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.
