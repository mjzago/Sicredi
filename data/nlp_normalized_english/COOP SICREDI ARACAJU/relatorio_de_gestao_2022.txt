The management of our cooperative is based on a full governance model, where our Board defines strategies, the Board defines tactical actions and our managers and all our employees carry out the tasks. All together with the same purpose. Over time, people are realizing the value and strength of cooperativism, especially in the financial market. Today, the role of cooperatives goes beyond that of a traditional financial institution. We are a way of promoting sustainable and inclusive economic development, generating the social well-being of individuals and communities where we are present. Given this reality, we can say that Sicredi Aracaju is playing this role well, but we still have a long way to go. We have to publicize that we are different from commercial banks, we have deliveries and different objectives, we need to show this, including to our associates, employees and society. The year 2022 was marked by great challenges, but especially by important achievements, the result of work done with great determination, with a greater commitment to fulfilling the purpose of cooperative, which is to build a more prosperous society together. We have added new management technologies to better serve our members. We expanded the individual platform, enabling account opening and meeting member needs through a digital and in-person experience at branches. Continuing the Expansion Plan, the Coroa do Meio branch was opened in the capital Sergipe, a new spacious and comfortable location, all designed to provide consultative service to legal entity members, in an exclusive manner Hermano Marinho President of Sicredi Aracaju6 PREFÁCIO. Sicredi Aracaju invested in improving management business, restructuring its commercial area, training its teams and remaining increasingly closer to our associates. We held our annual general meeting 100% digitally with elections for the Board of Directors for the four-year period and the Fiscal Council for the two-year period. The Cooperative also evolved in its internal management, investing in the training of its managers and employees. The greatest evidence of this commitment is the investment in the training of 23 students in the postgraduate course in Credit Cooperative Management. This commitment also materialized in the improvement of people management processes, with the implementation of performance management and climate research, which allowed us to obtain the international GPTW (Great Place to Work) certification for the second consecutive year, as a of the best companies to work for in Sergipe and in the country, among other important developments. We are increasingly connected with our purpose. Through the Avante Sicredi Aracaju Project (ASA), we offer the best in training and team development, creating a culture focused on results and always thinking about improving service to our more than 9 thousand members. We contribute to the economic and social development of the community where we operate by providing financial education through the Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis, with emphasis on partnerships with schools, encouraging sustainability through the preservation and donation of toys. The donated toys were intended for a more supportive Christmas in several needy communities. Our associates embraced the cause and contributed too, and all the children who benefited also received comic books themed on Financial Education. Through a partnership with the Municipal Department of Education and Culture of Nossa Senhora da Glória, we offer pedagogical advice specialized for all 9 municipal schools that serve children from the 1st to the 5th year, with the aim of training teachers, coordinators and directors to include the Financial Education Topic in the School Curriculum. During National Financial Education Week, we reached more than 1,500 people in person, with actions in schools, companies and in all our service units. We also held a Feirão in a public square to raise awareness of the issue. We seek to promote among associates and future associates a greater understanding of credit cooperative societies by extending our Crescer Cooperative Education Program to the Sicredi digital Education platform in the Community and, thus, becoming more accessible with another alternative beyond in-person, promoting education, training and information available to everyone.7 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 202201 Participation8 OUR COOPERATIVA/OUR CENTRALBoard of Directors Supervisory BoardO Sicredi Aracaju's Board of Directors is made up of 10 effective members, with their duties defined in the Cooperative's Bylaws.

One of the seven principles of cooperativism is democratic management, and in practice, Sicredi Aracaju is an organization democratically managed by its more than nine thousand members, who actively participate in formulating policies and making decisions at general assemblies every year. This principle of cooperativism ensures that everyone follows the policies and evolution of the institution, participating in all decisions, electing their representatives and defining directions of business. We are made of people for people, and this is one of our great differences. Our business model values ​​everyone's participation, in a democratic and transparent process. This is one of the principles of cooperativism that safeguards our cooperative governance. Here, everyone has the opportunity to decide and participate, thus creating bonds of trust that allow us to grow together.Jorge Viana Executive DirectorRicardo Moscoso Operations Director 10 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM1002 120 years of Cooperativism11 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM11Today, more than 120 years after the creation of the first cooperative in Brazil, this model is increasingly stronger. Based on the voluntary association of people around a common objective. Cooperatives bring together millions of people around the world in projects that generate income, job opportunities and promote regional development. In addition to all this, cooperativism promotes equality, affirming, in practice, that we are all equal. Jorge Viana Executive Director In 2022, Sicredi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They began a cooperative venture that inspired creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining through time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all associates and promoting quality of life.12 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 202212 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 2022Timeline Learn about some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law no. 4,595/64, which imposed normative restrictions on the operation of credit cooperatives. 5,764/71 which defined the legal regime for cooperative societies. 1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.

Find out more about our history in the publication A Trajetória do Sicredi: https://www.sicredi.com.br/trajetoria/ 14 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 202214 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 20221 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer salary account is mandatory for its employees, in a credit union membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity for their members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each product or financial service that members contract in the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF C OOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (Cooperative Alliance International) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:15 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM155 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Growth and Cooperation in Ponta do Lápis, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their region 3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to your pocket, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can be controlled only by its members, in a model of democratic management.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advancement of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing quality food and essential items at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans got together and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each member contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped opening the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives for understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved.16 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 202216 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 2022Our cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM By playing our active role as members, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and is transformed into the supply of jobs, products and services, generation of income and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism configures in a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: 17 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM17In addition to promoting economic development, Sicredi Aracaju works directly to improve the Sergipe community, and we are developing projects and actions that demonstrate this commitment in practice. Our vision is to be recognized by society as a financial institution, the cooperative is committed to the economic and social development of members and communities, with sustainable growth. “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good” As can be seen, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory that we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact on society, through the essence of cooperativism.

Our history was built by several hands. On September 15 1998, with the presence of 25 doctors, the assembly to create our cooperative was held. Two months later, the Central Bank authorized its operation, and on July 1, 1999, the cooperative began its activities. The first president was doctor Carlos Alberto Mendonça, then president of Unimed Sergipe. In a small room with few resources, three enthusiastic doctors formed the committee that founded the cooperative, Doctor José Sérvulo Sampaio Nunes, Doctor Jorge Viana and Doctor Virginia Barreto, with the unforgettable and important support of Unimed. In this first composition, Dr. José Sérvulo was the first Financial Director. The dream was just beginning. The number of members grew and the cooperative gained more and more expression. In 2002, the cooperative, which had only 10 employees and 437 members, became headquartered at Rua Duque de Caxias, number 469. From then on, the number of members began to grow and the cooperative gains more strength. In 2009, we took a courageous step towards a more promising future, and the challenge was even greater. The service capacity of the branch on Rua Duque de Caxias could no longer meet the growth of the membership, so we took a bolder decision, transferring the cooperative to Avenida Francisco Porto, where the main financial institutions in Aracaju operated. The decision was not unanimous, the fear of failure knocked on our doors, but We moved forward and the result was better than we imagined. The number of Associates and results grew even more. Time passed and our cooperative evolved. We reached the year 2013, which was very important for our cooperative, as the Central Bank of Brazil accepted the free admission proposal made by our members at the Assembly and we opened the doors for everyone to join. We become stronger. As of January 2016, our cooperative held an Extraordinary General Meeting to, together with its associates, approve membership of the Sicredi System, and join the oldest cooperative financial institution in Brazil, with more than 300 financial solutions. Today, we have more than nine thousand members, eight service units and significant growth over these 24 years, our Cooperative is consolidating itself every day as a safe and reliable Financial Institution. Our Purpose21 OUR COOPERATIVE/OUR CENTRALThe progressive growth of the cooperative's Net Equity and Total Assets is a direct consequence of the ability to generate results and reflects the trust that Sicredi Aracaju has gained among Sergipe society. We are part of a national system, made up of millions of other members who jointly decide the direction of the business and form a network that supports its prosperity with responsible financial solutions. To the Over 24 years, Sicredi Aracaju has been consolidating itself as much more than a financial institution that offers services, credit, insurance and investments. We are growing, conquering new spaces, expanding our service points and gaining new individual, legal and agricultural members. This is only possible due to the cooperation that unites us. Trust, credibility and partnership at all times are what have made us take great strides, since 1998 and Today, they position themselves as a cooperative financial institution highly rated by our members.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our incorporation we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social, and governance) seeks to demonstrate that the survival of Organizations in the long term depend on them also generating value in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the market's “ESG vision”, understanding it as the management itself for business sustainability. Sicredi's three essential strategic guidelines that guide everything we do: Mission, Vision and Values; They describe the guidelines that guide our business and guide our development in practice. Based on our guidelines, we build the documents and systemic policies that guide our strategy, decision-making, operations and conduct. The Sustainability Policy establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact. To guide our sustainable development strategy, we have established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.27 DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY We have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicredi's material themes, that is, the most relevant themes for Sicredi's sustainability.

There was also popcorn, cotton and candy and lots of fun for the kids. Simple attitudes move the world! Raimundo José de Carvalho Lagarto Nursery 35 RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS Financial Education Day in schools In 2022 we will hold it in Nossa Senhora da Glória, through a partnership with the Municipal Department of Education and Culture, the Journey of Financial Education in Schools. The purpose of this initiative was to train teachers to include the topic “Financial Education”, across the classroom, in accordance with the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC). This action is the practice of the 5th and 7th principle of Cooperativism, which aim at education, training and information and interest in the community. With the support of Sicredi Foundation, Sicredi Aracaju provided a Pedagogical Advisor who trained and certified 8 directors, 10 coordinators and 34 teachers from the 9 municipal schools that cover Elementary Education I. All students, from the 1st to the 5th year, received the Class's comic books da Mônica, and throughout the second semester the teachers promoted the inclusion of the Financial Education theme in their classes, using Sicredi's authorial methodology.36 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 2022 Sustainability Committee Sicredi Aracaju implemented the Sustainability Committee, which aims to establish locally the support structure for the implementation of the Sustainability Policy and Systemic Sustainability Strategy, as one of the governance structures for the topic, advising the Board of Directors so that decision-making considers the responsibilities, opportunities and economic, social, environmental and climate challenges that involve themes relevant to sustainability at Sicredi and for our stakeholders. In this sense, the initiative is divided into three bases: relationship and cooperativism, which seeks to further value the close relationship with members, so that they can create a support network and continue generating good business; responsible solutions, which consists of always recommending the best financial solutions to the member, in a responsible manner and appropriate to the moment in their life; It is local development, transforming the credit cooperative, together with the community and members, into a driving agent for development. Strategically built with professionals from different areas of the cooperative, the Sustainability Committee also aims to encourage employees, members and the community to develop actions that defend the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations (UN) and which are linked to the theme. With the initiative, action strategies are structured and debated at quarterly meetings, on an ordinary basis and, when necessary, on an extraordinary basis, always with minutes recorded. The intention is for participants to always focus on the social, environmental and economic aspects, aiming at possibilities for improving processes and opportunities for carrying out new projects at Sicredi Aracaju.37 COOPERATIVA XXXXXXX 2022 Café com o Presidente As a way of To approach the legal public and present the cooperative's differences, Sicredi Aracaju held the “Coffee with the President” event.

During the events, the President of Sicredi Aracaju, Dr. Hermano Marinho, representatives of the Executive Board and the commercial area, as well as businesspeople from various sectors of commerce and services, were present. The objective of the meeting was to present the cooperative's differences and how we can contribute to improving business, generating new partnerships. According to Dr. Hermano, “historically, cooperatives collaborate in in a significant way for the local economy, as members participate in the results and investments remain in their place of origin.” After each edition of the event, the commercial team carried out prospecting and relationship actions, providing excellent results, such as opening accounts and contracting the cooperative's products.38 RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONSPRODUCT DESCRIPTION Solar Energy CreditSolar Energy Credit is a specific financing product for The acquisition of solar energy technology to assist members interested in using alternative and renewable sources of energy generation in their activities.
