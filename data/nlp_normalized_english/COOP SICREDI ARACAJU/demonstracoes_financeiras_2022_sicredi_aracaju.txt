Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in section below, entitled “Auditor’s responsibilities for auditing the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards.

Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report.

We have nothing to report in this regard.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 Conjunto A - Block A 1st floor - living room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF - Brazil Tel: +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.brResponsibilities of the board and governance for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of statements financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue a report audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain evidence of appropriate and sufficient audit to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We have obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to design audit procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the operational continuity capacity of the Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasília, February 27, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machine and 100% digital account, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of the our premises since our founding. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperation, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with the fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50% , and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in the global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good growth of GDP in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity are already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching a record decline and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in the October reading, on the other hand, the entry of these three shakers was accompanied by an increase in default and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. Through the credit lines granted to members, we support the maintenance of economic activity in Aracaju and in the interior cities where We act, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life for members and society. Our traditional credit lines remained active, as did the offer of other financial solutions to broadly meet the needs of our members, including those related to Agribusiness. During the 2022 financial year, we added new management technologies to better serve our associates, without, however, compromising significantly reduce the cooperative's expenses. We expanded the individual platform, making it possible to open accounts and meet the needs of members through a digital and in-person experience at branches. Continuing the Expansion Plan, the Coroa do Meio agency was opened in the capital Sergipe, a new spacious and comfortable location, all designed to provide consultancy service to legal entity members, in an exclusive manner. Sicredi Aracaju invested in improving business management, restructuring your commercial area, training your teams and remaining closer to our associates. In the first half of the year, we held our annual general meeting 100% digitally with elections for the Board of Directors for the four-year period and the Fiscal Council for the two-year period. The Cooperative also evolved in its internal management, investing in the training of its managers and employees. The greatest evidence of this commitment is the investment in the training of 23 students in the postgraduate course in Credit Cooperative Management. We are increasingly improving processes related to the People Management area, which began in 2020 and has been constantly developing new procedures to regularize relationships in the Cooperative. We restructured the Apprentice and Intern Development Program, focusing on the development of group behavioral skills, with experiential activities and the development of improvement projects for the Cooperative. We trained the CIPA (Internal Accident Prevention Committee), as well as the formation of the Cooperative Fire Brigade with the aim of training employees to act in prevention and combating fires and first aid. In the year 2022, the partnership with the consultancy Yassaka began, with a focus on developing the skills and abilities of employees, aimed at further reinforcing cooperative practices, improving service toassociate. Finally, we emphasize that the Performance Management process was implemented in the Cooperative in a pilot phase, a continuous process of identifying, measuring and developing the performance of individuals and teams, and the alignment of this performance with the organization's strategic objectives. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact In the regions where we operate, these are premises since our founding. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: We contribute to the economic and social development of the community where we are located by expanding the actions of the Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis throughout the year, with emphasis on partnerships carried out with private schools where we provide comic book magazines with the theme of Financial Education and raise awareness all lower elementary school students to donate toys, encouraging sustainability through preservation and giving. The donated toys were destined for needy children with the support of other partners on our “C Day” for a more Solidarity Christmas in several needy communities. Our associates embraced the cause and also contributed, and all the children who benefited also received comic books themed on Financial Education. Through another partnership, now with the Municipal Department of Education and Culture of Nossa Senhora da Glória, we promote the Financial Education Journey in Schools, offering specialized pedagogical assistance to all 9 municipal schools serving children from 1st to 5th grade, with the aim of training teachers, coordinators and directors to include the Financial Education Theme in the School Curriculum, in a structured manner, in accordance with the National Common Curricular Base, through Sicredi's authorial methodology with a local perspective, with equity and inclusion. We were closer to the community, with actions also in local squares, both during National Week of Financial Education, where we held a Feirão to raise awareness of the topic, and on C-Day, where we promoted a Financial Education movie with Turma da Mônica with stories that portray conscious consumption in a playful way, ways to save, among other financial guidelines, for adults and children. We seek to promote a greater understanding of cooperative credit associations among members and future members by extending our Crescer Cooperative Education Program to the Sicredi digital education platform in the Community and, thus, we become more accessible with another alternative beyond in-person, promoting education, training and information available to everyone. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from Banco Central and BNDES. In 2022 we had the corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in terms of physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society. Board of Directors and Board of Directors Even in the face of so many challenges, Sicredi Aracaju preserved its solidity and remained strong and sustainable. This evolution is the result of professional management exercised by a Board of Directors committed to the interests of members, an active Fiscal Council guided by ethics and the preservation of the financial maturity of the Cooperative, an experienced, innovative and competent Executive Board, in addition to a technical staff of excellent professional levelACTIVES 635,571 546,387 LIABILITIES 554,571 466,560 AVAILABILITY (Note 04) 21,381 11,467 DEPOSITS (Note 11) 501,519 423.889                                            INSTRUMENTOS FINANCEIROS 616.023                                       533.120                                               Depósitos à vista 98.371                                         85.761                                                  Aplicações interfinanceiras de liquidez (Nota 05) 5.028                                           5.281                                                   Depósitos interfinanceiros 3.833 171 Securities (Note 06) 7,224 7,224 Term deposits 399,315 337,957 Financial centralization (Note 04) 313,985 225,108 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 10,633 8.148                                                    Relações interfinanceiras ativas 12                                                 -
