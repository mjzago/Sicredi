Sicredi, as a cooperative financial institution, is committed to the growth of its members and the development of the regions where it operates. We remain firm in our commitment to contributing to the economic activity of communities, considering their different realities and needs, constantly seeking to create opportunities for connection between members and others. new technological trends, stimulating income generation and local economic and social development, with the aim of having a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable society every day. Close relationships are essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, even more so in a period of economic recovery, offering financial solutions for micro and small businesses, small rural producers, self-employed professionals and other associates. We did all this without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it increased the prices of several commodities even further, a since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to go through the wave of the Ômicron variant, without the need of major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion. The growth of the physical service network is aligned with the objectives of being close to meeting the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of members and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new members. With roots In the field, and through a long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 2nd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness. Also, this semester, we ranked 4th among the best financial institutions in Brazil in the World’s Best Banks 2022 ranking, carried out by Forbes in partnership with Statista.

Processes and policies for liquidity risk management are established following the criteria current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each System Institution. The Sicredi System's liquidity risk management processes include: • Definition of processes to identify, evaluate, monitor and control exposure to liquidity risk over different time horizons; • The establishment of processes for tracking and reporting compliance with liquidity risk appetite and at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Definition of funding strategies that provide adequate diversification of funding sources and maturity dates; • Definition of a liquidity contingency plan, regularly updated, that establishes responsibilities and procedures to face liquidity stress situations; • Periodic carrying out stress tests with short and long-term scenarios. VII - Credit Risk Credit risk management consists of the process of identifying, measurement, control and mitigation of risks arising from credit operations carried out by financial institutions. At Sicredi, Credit Risk management is carried out by a centralized structure and by local areas and bodies. Banco Cooperativo Sicredi is responsible for the set of policies, strategies and methodologies aimed at controlling and managing the exposure to credit risk of the companies that make up the System, with the main tasks being: responding to corporate credit risk management policies; develop and propose credit risk classification methodologies, including through quantitative models; assess and control capital requirements to cover assumed credit risk; and carry out constant monitoring of exposures subject to credit risk of all Sicredi companies. OIRRBB is the risk, current or prospective, of the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the results or economic value of the institution, resulting from instruments classified in the banking book. IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the scale of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing IRRBB risk. To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation results (NII) approaches are used. The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations.
