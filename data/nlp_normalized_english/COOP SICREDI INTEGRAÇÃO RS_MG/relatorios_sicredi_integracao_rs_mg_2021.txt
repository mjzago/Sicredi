In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento de Lajeado - Sicredi Integração RS/MG as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and their cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the principles relevant ethical standards provided for in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements carried out on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their immediate convertibility, (ii) balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for financial intermediation revenue, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other inflows and revenues operational and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification . Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board of directors is responsible for preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the development process of the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian standards and international auditing, always detects any relevant distortions that exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or in the aggregate, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users made based on said financial statements.3 As part of the audit carried out, of In accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise judgment professional and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the estimates accounting records and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work. Porto Alegre, February 21, 2022 ERNST & YOUNG Independent Auditors S.S. CRC – 2SP015199/F-7 Américo F. Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9#MANAGEMENT REPORT In this document, the administration of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of Lajeado - Sicredi Integração RS/MG, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the report of independent auditors on the Financial Statements. The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of economic activity in communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to the improvement of quality of life for associates and society. Our traditional credit lines remained active, as well as the lines of emergency programs from the Government. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which has made it possible to expand the range of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic service systems (automated teller machines, internet banking, app), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow most operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating face-to-face in all agencies, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. We highlight the following administrative facts: opening of the Fisital Univates Lajeado/RS branch, opening of three branches in M ​​G (Congonhas, Entre Rios de Minas and Mariana) and expansion of the Mato Leitão/RS branch. On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: Philanthropic Fund, A União Faz a Vida program, School Cooperatives program, Financial Education project “Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis” (Jornada nas Escolas), Day “C” (Cooperate day), ENEF week and the Crescer course with Center Coordinators and Associates. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that the demands of members were met, especially those related to facing the pandemic and the recovery economic. Among the actions, we highlight the expansion of in-person opening hours for members.

Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of the CPC 23, as below: (a) Inflows from intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows from intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and must be considered as income and revenue from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20 There was a change in the way in which the statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to non-operating income or losses is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into account groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenses and expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the statements. financial.

Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in payment of the principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, to the debtors and guarantors, the delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions no. 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN.
