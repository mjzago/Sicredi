Marcio José Algayer Executive Director CPF: 813.764.800-34 Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of Vale do Rio Pardo - Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo RS Statements Financial Statements 2022 Executive Board of Administration Superintendency of Controllership Independent auditor's report on the financial statements To the Administrators, Advisors and Cooperatives of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of Vale do Rio Pardo - Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo RS Santa Cruz do Sul - RS Opinião We examined the financial statements of the Cooperativa d e Crédito, Poupança e Investimento do Vale do Rio Pardo - Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo RS (“Cooperative”) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in net equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative on December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor’s responsibilities for auditing the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be significantly distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report this respect. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN), and for the internal controls it determined were necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless that the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the referred to the financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain evidence appropriate and sufficient audit performance to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We have obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but, no, for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we must draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead to Cooperative no longer maintains operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and findings audits, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasília, March 13, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8 In 2022, to celebrate the cooperative's 103rd anniversary, Sicredi Vale d o Rio Pardo RS welcomed members and savers with a series of special gifts. The campaign "Award-Winning Cooperation" strengthened the relationship with Cooperativa Sicredi members in all 15 branches. A scoring model based on the proportion of applications and investments was the basis for the fair distribution of gifts. A pioneer in the system for credit and promotion of photovoltaic generation, Sicredi VRP continues to focus on credit to add income (more than 3,200 plants have already been financed), promotion of the sector, given the aspects of generating new business, income, new jobs work, municipal taxes and mainly given environmental sustainability. In this context and evolving to improve, the cooperative in 2022 implemented the Integrator Development Program (PDI), moving to a stage of technical, financial and managerial certification for which it established strategic partnerships with Unisc, Delphos and Sebrae. The program led to the certification of more than 30 companies in 2022. Another important partnership established in 2022 was with SEBRAE through which provides advice and consultancy for around 15 family agribusinesses, including one agroindustry associated with a C ooperative agency. These organizations are very important in the logic of regional development, adding value to primary production, generating new opportunities and strengthening the local economy. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more of 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to share in the results and in the decisions of cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts:Administration Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve conditions life of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of increasing interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risk assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in the October reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the price escalation. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperousWe value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: With the aim of stimulating leadership, citizenship, knowledge, youth protagonism and entrepreneurship, Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo has been developing the School Cooperatives Program since 2016. We started 2022 with 9 school cooperatives founded in region of operation and we arrived in December with three more. In total, twelve school cooperatives reaffirm and strengthen the cooperative movement. The students are building work that promotes cooperation for a more prosperous and fraternal world, which is in line with cooperative principles, what we believe in and work to build. Through the Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis, Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo develops segmented financial education actions for different audiences and School Financial Education Day. In total, more than 5 thousand people in the region will be impacted by the program in 2022. The program carries out segmented actions with different audiences, such as children, young people, individuals and individual micro-entrepreneurs. Last year, the cooperative registered around 80 activities that impacted more than 3,800 people. The Financial Education Day in Schools involved 27 students, 1,382 students and 136 teachers.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering the factor es and premises established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions They include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable realization or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision depending on the delay in the payment of the principal portion or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. Details of provisions and liabilities contingents is presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III - Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets assets may incur considerable judgments, especially when measuring potential associated future economic benefits; IV - Measurement of the effects arising from covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of market and its financial instruments, the production of new operations credit and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyAccounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. The liabilities contingents assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimatesq) Provision for civil, tax and labor risksDescription Total 1,109,576 945.739                                                              44.074                                               30.57 0 H 100,00                                              16.278                                      13.690                                                              16.278                                               13.69 0 G 70,00                                                5.38 0                                       2.205 3.766                                                 1.5 44 F 50,00                                                6.80 9                                       4.360                                                                 3.404                                                 2.1 80 E 30,00                                              10.887                                        6.315                                                                 3.266 1.8 94 D 10,00                                              67.256                                      30.112                                                                 6.718                                                 2.9 97 C 3,00                                            144.683                                     95.850                                                                 4.336                                                 2.8 71 B 1,00 413.755 325.640 4.138 3.2 51 A 0,50 434.088 429.778 2.168 2.1 43 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 AA - 10.440 37,789 - - The amounts of securities and credits receivable were reclassified to the heading of amounts receivable relating to payment transactions to adapt the accounting of card payment transactions, in accordance with Circular Letter 3,828/17.

Such processes are composed of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated throughout the institution; • Identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation of operational risks; •Identification, collection and treatment of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk topics and internal controls to governance forums; • Dissemination of the risk management culture throughout the organization; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses arising from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic testing of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to evaluate, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution.

For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: •The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the binding of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incur significant losses; and •The possibility that the institution will not be able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market. The liquidity risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing processes, policies and systems that support System entities in managing liquidity risk. The processes and policies for managing liquidity risk are established following the criteria of current regulations, aligned with best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each System Institution. The processes for managing the liquidity risk of the Sicredi System include: • Definition of processes to identify, evaluate, monitor and control the exposure to liquidity risk over different time horizons; • The establishment of processes for tracking and reporting compliance with liquidity risk appetite and at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Definition of funding strategies that provide adequate diversification of funding sources and maturity dates; • Definition of a liquidity contingency plan, regularly updated, that establishes responsibilities and procedures to deal with liquidity stress situations; • Periodic performance of stress tests with short and long-term scenarios. The processes and policies for managing market risk are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Si credi System's market risk management processes include: • Clear market classification rules trading portfolio that guarantees the correct treatment of operations; • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to market risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's market risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of market risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of products and the size of the exposure to market risk of the System's institutions. V - Risk of Variation in Interest Rates on Classified Instruments in the Banking Portfolio (IRRBB) IRRBB is the risk, current or prospective, of the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the results or economic value of the institution, resulting of instruments classified in the banking book. IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized in Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing IRRBB risk. To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation results (NII) approaches are used. The system Sicredi defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for managing IRRBB risk in the Si credi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to your capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the IRR BB risk exposure of the System's institutions. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the main business processes are identified of the institution as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the continuity strategies of the business adopted. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard set out the basic principles and the necessary structure to ensure an adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of entities. The Business Continuity Management system structured in Si credi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and IT disaster recovery strategies; • Operational and IT continuity plans. Finally, Sicredi makes available to all its agencies a model of agency continuity manual, which allows the creation of a customized document, in order to meet the main scenarios of interruption of activities=. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in market values ​​of positions held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices. Market risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. A centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing market risk. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue to delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of their services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved.

Cybersecurity or cybersecurity risks are part of the context of information security risks. At Sicredi, information security risk management is carried out jointly with Banks, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives, which are responsible for compliance with internal and external regulations, relying on systemic tools and methodologies that can be complemented by local actions. Processes and actions aimed at information security aim to maintain risks at acceptable levels, including the use of adequate and effective controls, taking into account costs, technology and business objectives. XI - Additional Information The description of the complete structure and risk and capital management process can be accessed through the website www.sicredi.com.br, in the path: About us > Reports > Risk Management > Systemic Publications > Risk Management Pillar 3 - Systemic. The Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy and the Sustainability Report, documents with the details and numbers of the processes on the topic, can also be accessed through the website www.sicredi.com.br, on the path: About us > Sustainability > Policies and Reports. Socio-environmental risk is defined as the possibility of losses to financial institutions resulting from social, environmental and climate damage. Furthermore, it is indirectly involved with a series of other risks, which can generate financial, legal and reputational impacts. At Sicredi, management is carried out by a centralized structure and by local areas and bodies. The processes and policies for managing socio-environmental risk are established following the criteria of regulations in force, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the system. The processes for managing the socio-environmental risk of the Sicredi system include: • Internal standards containing rules, methodologies and responsibilities regarding the management of the topic; • Monitoring delimitations and fences of exposures subject to socio-environmental risk, in line with the system's risk appetite; • Collection and use of data for measuring, classifying and evaluating social, environmental and climate risks in operations; • Periodic carrying out stress tests for socio-environmental risk scenarios; • Interlocution and reporting to environmental bodies, federations, business partners and governance forums; • Constant evolution of the strategy on the topic, aiming to align with market techniques and technologies, as well as the expectations of interested parties. IX - Compliance risk The risk of Compliance is defined as the possibility of sanctions, financial losses, reputational damage and other damages resulting from non-compliance or failure to comply with external regulations (laws and regulations), recommendations from regulatory bodies, applicable self-regulation codes as well as official internal regulations. Compliance risk management within the scope of Sicredi is under the responsibility of the Compliance Superintendence, an integral structure of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A, which, for systemic monitoring, offers support and information, both to the areas of companies in the Administrative Center and to Central and Individual Cooperatives, regarding the compliance process and compliance risk management. The compliance function is performed in the development and execution of the Compliance Program, structured around the pillars of: (i) Prevention, (ii) Detection and (iii) Correction. The processes for managing the compliance risk include: • Identification of the institution's compliance risks; • Communication, training and training of all levels of the Entity and to adequately manage compliance risks and comply with legal and (self)regulatory requirements; • Monitoring and monitoring of relevant processes, actions taken to mitigate compliance risks and correct deficiencies, with the aim of promoting compliance. • Report of relevant adjustments and new measures to mitigate risks, as well as identified non-conformities; • Identification of actions and/or processes associated with the main risks, which need to be reviewed, updated or implemented, seeking the effectiveness of the Compliance Program as a whole; • Treatment of identified non-compliances as well as development of awareness raising actions, seeking to prevent recurrence. X - Information Security RiskVII - Credit Risk Management of credit risk Credit consists of the process of identifying, measuring, controlling and mitigating risks arising from credit operations carried out by financial institutions. At Sicredi, Credit Risk management is carried out by a centralized structure and by local areas and bodies. Banco Cooperativo Sicredi is responsible for the set of policies, strategies and methodologies aimed at controlling and managing exposures to credit risk of the companies that make up the System, with the following main responsibilities: responding to corporate credit risk management policies; develop and propose credit risk classification methodologies, including through quantitative models; assess and control capital requirements to cover assumed credit risk; and carry out constant monitoring of exposures subject to credit risk of all Sicredi companies.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with the adjustments arising from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a counterpart to the account of accumulated surpluses or losses, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. Said plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution no. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the implementation plan for said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in case issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan. NOTE 32 – INSURANCE CONTRACTED As of December 31, 2022, the insurance contracted is considered sufficient by management to cover possible claims related to the guarantee of values ​​and assets owned by the Cooperativ a. The risk assumptions adopted, given their nature, are not part of the scope of a statement audit financial, consequently and are not examined by our independent auditors. NOTE 33 – OTHER INFORMATION
