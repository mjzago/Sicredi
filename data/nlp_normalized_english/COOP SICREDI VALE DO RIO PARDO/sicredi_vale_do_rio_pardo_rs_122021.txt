In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento do Vale do Rio Pardo - Sicredi Vale do Rio Pardo RS as of December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to the note explanatory no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to its immediate convertibility, (ii) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits to revenue from financial intermediation, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operating results for the groups of other operating income and revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification . Our opinion does not contain caveat related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid ceasing operations. Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those with responsibility for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the The audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian standards and international audit firms, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion . The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We assess the adequacy of policies accounting estimates used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should call attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Ferreira Neto CRC-1SP192685/O-9 Administration in this document, DECREE DECORATIVE ADMINISTRATION, SAVING DOVALO DORIOPARDO -Sicredi Vale Dorio Pardo RS, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements relating to the year ending on 31 December 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission aggregate income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We continue to expand our offer solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable, since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we are back to operating face-to-face in all branches, following the protocols of health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we highlight the opening of our new administrative headquarters in the municipality of Santa Cruz do Sul (RS) and the opening of the General Câmara branch (RS), both in modern spaces that will provide better service to members. In August we inaugurated the photovoltaic energy production plant, which is guaranteeing 100% energy autonomy for all structures physical properties of the Cooperative. On another front, the cooperative has developed numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social activities carried out in 2021: - Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis: 75 actions, 1430 people impacted; -Cooperation Program in Ponta doLápis -Elementary Education/Early Years: nine municipalities, 11 schools, 55 classes and more than 1,000 students impacted; -AUnião FazaVida Program -Early Childhood Education: performance in three municipalities, 18 Early Childhood Education schools and more than 1,500 children were impacted; -School Cooperatives -Elementary Education/Final Years: six municipalities, 10 schools and more than 500 students/members, among many others involved; - Plante o Futuro Program - Technical Secondary Education: five municipalities, six schools and 80 students benefiting from scholarships. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to the pandemic and the economic recovery. Among the actions, we highlight the 2021 cycle of the Social Fund, which served 93 projects, in which the amount invested was directed towards resolving the impacts of the pandemic, supporting and promoting social projects with an impact on people's lives. Another action, on "C Day", distributed more than 26 tons of food through the voluntary mobilization of the cooperative and the community. The donations benefited 28 entities, many of them in the health and social assistance areas. Furthermore, partnerships with Sebrae and entities representing entrepreneurs and farmers guaranteed the possibility of supporting members in facing the impacts of the pandemic, which allows us to affirm that we fulfilled our mission and achieved our purpose. 3,809 DEPOSITS (Note 12) 720,973 633,664 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 1,177,036 996,604 Demand deposits 168,742 152,705 Interbank liquidity applications (Note 05) 10,954 57,783 Savings deposits 356 -

The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to the works or losses of the result does not operational is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to the change in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify them as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the cash and cash equivalent initial and final period ending on December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of titles and securities where they were previously presented.
