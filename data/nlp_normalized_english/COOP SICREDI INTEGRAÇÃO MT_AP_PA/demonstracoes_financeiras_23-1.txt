The main accounting practices adopted for the preparation of the financial statements were: a) Calculation of the result Income and expenditure, as well as revenue and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the jurisdiction regime, which establishes that inputs and expenditures and revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of the results of the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated, regardless of receipt or payment, allocated in a proportional manner according to the amounts of the gross income from the cooperative act and the gross income from non-cooperative act, when not identified with each activity. Operations with fixed rates are recorded at redemption value, and the income and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities. Income and expenses of a financial nature are accounted for on a pro-rata basis and calculated based on the exponential model, except those relating to discounted securities or related to foreign operations, which are calculated based on the linear method. Operations with post-fixed rates or indexed to foreign currencies are updated up to the balance sheet date. In the semester ended June 30, 2023, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ 749 (June 2022 - R$ 491) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts.

These assets do not depreciate and are measured at fair value in accordance with the criteria established by CPC 46, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,748/19. •Own: represent assets owned by the cooperative, which are not used in the performance of social activity, and are available for immediate sale whose disposal is highly probable within a maximum period of one year. • Received from third parties: represent goods received as a gift in payment of debts, not intended for personal use. They are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to the Administration's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in compensation accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. g) Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of operations, taking into account the economic situation, past experience, specific and global risks of the portfolios, considering the provisioning criteria, defined in CMN Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00, associated with evaluations carried out by the Administration, in determining credit risks.d) Securities The portfolio is made up of securities fixed income, variable income and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to their respective fair values, as applicable. e) Inter-financial relations – financial centralization Financial centralization comprises the cooperative's cash reserves, not invested in its activities, which are centralized through inter-financial transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are applied in the market financial and/or loaned to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations Term deposits are made up of values ​​agreed for availability within pre-established deadlines, which are updated by remunerative financial charges according to their post-fixed contract and are demonstrated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses.

Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions for the purpose of financing operations.m) Reduction in recoverable value of assets Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of an asset's net selling price and value in use. n) Deposits, loan obligations and onlendings They are demonstrated by the amounts of liabilities, considering the charges, monetary exchange variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability is immediate to associated partners, therefore without determined deadline to move them, at the discretion of the resource holder does so according to their needs.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realizable or recovery value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00.

Contingent assets with probable successes are only disclosed in a note explanatory; • Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success.
