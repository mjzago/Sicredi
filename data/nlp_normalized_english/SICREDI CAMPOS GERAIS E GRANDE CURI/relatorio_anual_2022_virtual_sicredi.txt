Sicredi Campos Gerais and Grande Curitiba PR/SPAnnual 2022ReportDear Associates, With great pride, I present the last annual report of my management as president of Sicredi Campos Gerais and Grande Curitiba PR/SP. It was a very successful 8 years, in which we built the balanced and sustainable growth of the two fundamental pillars of cooperativism: economic and social. During my management we also went through challenging moments, such as facing a pandemic, where We lost many associates, including our then vice-president, Mr. Gilberto Zardo, who contributed greatly with his experience and knowledge to our management. During the pandemic, we showed the strength of cooperation, taking care of people and always meeting all the demands of members, whether on federal government lines or in the cooperative's own operations, as we have a ﬁnancially structured cooperative and a team of employees and highly-rated leaders committed and engaged. We believe that we have a prosperous future in our hands and that we can make a better world, starting with small attitudes and maintaining the differences of being cooperative. If elected by you, I plan to continue in the position of vice-president, advising and working towards this ideal, always supporting this incredible team, a second family that Sicredi gave me. Finally, I would like to thank you for all your support to the throughout these years. We will continue to overcome objectives, working guided by our purpose of building a more prosperous society together. Popk and Ferdinand Van der Vinne | President Sicredi Campos Gerais and Greater Curitiba PR/SPAnnual Report 2022Dear Associates, With this 2022 management report, we report on another record year, gaining associates and collaborators, which directly benefits the economic and social aspects of the communities where our cooperative is included. With the new challenge to come, this year I end my cycle as executive director of this cooperative, a role that I performed with great honor, dedication and with many achievements that we built together. My joy is that we continue together in pursuit of the constant mission of leaving the world better than we found it and building a more prosperous society. I have been part of Sicredi for 26 years and for 17 years I have been at Sicredi Campos Gerais and Grande Curitiba PR/SP. In 2006 – with the support of Central PR/SP/RJ, I took on the important mission of being the executive director of our cooperative. With God's blessings, together with a wonderful team, presidents and advisors who have always supported us, we took this cooperative from one of the 8 smallest in Paraná, to one of the 10 largest in Brazil, considering all systems. We ended this cycle surpassing incredible milestones such as 100 thousand associates and more than R$ 100 million in results, 3rd largest in Central. Within the cooperative's governance procedures, at the end of 2022, the Board of Directors, starting the composition of the new slate, appointed me to be the new president. Upon the approval of the members at the meetings, with great honor and responsibility I will assume this role, counting on a qualified board of directors, and a competent board, formed in-house – Leila Grik as the new executive director, Reinaldo Oliveira as the new business director, Tilene Farina continuing as operations director – all imbued with the Sicredi Way of Being, so together, inspired by the symbol of cooperativism, represented by the two pine trees, social and economic, increasingly stronger and balanced, as contemporary cooperativism wants, we seek the better for our associates and communities.
