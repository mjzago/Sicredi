The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it further increased the prices of several commodities, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, The first half of the year saw continuity in the economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to overcome the wave of the Ômicron variant, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 The Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following were classified as cash and cash equivalents amounts:r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. Settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of their determination. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 07; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by the Administration, constituting a provision for demands of a fiscal, civil, tax and labor nature through legal assessments. Assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 16; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; Classification of information: Unrestricted Use Credit card transactions refer to the values receive relating to payment transactions, whether from associates or from Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A.
