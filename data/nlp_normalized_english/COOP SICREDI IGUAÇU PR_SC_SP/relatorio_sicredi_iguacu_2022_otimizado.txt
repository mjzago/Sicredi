A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins came with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. 263.5 billion in assets reinvested in the community of members in more than 100 cooperatives affiliated to Sicredi6.5 million 2.4 thousand branches throughout o Brazil 11 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 202211Between Father Amstad's pioneering spirit and recent statistics, credit cooperativism preserves principles. When generating positive results, the leftovers return to the member, also adding income through fairer rates and fees. With the possibility of reinvesting resources in the cooperative itself and in the community where it operates, the system has established itself as an important agent in regional development. Eleuterio Benin Director Executive Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They began a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other boxes of rural credit in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining over time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all associates and promoting quality of life.12 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM12Timeline Discover some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law no. 4,595/64, which imposed normative restrictions on the operation of credit cooperatives. 5,764/71 which defined the legal regime for cooperative societies. 1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.

Find out more about our history in the publication A Trajetória do Sicredi: https://www.sicredi.com.br/trajetoria/ 14 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM141 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a mandatory salary account to their employees, in a cooperative credit membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to their members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be inserted in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as leadership election, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:15 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 202215THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact: 5 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the more solid path to generating prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their community.3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of cooperative, that is, the results of the operations generated by the money invested by the members return to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. Sicredi System Numbers 6.4 million members 2.4 thousand branches 105 cooperatives 1,700 municipalities with branches 38 thousand employees R$263.5 billion in assets R$173.3 billion in credit portfolio R$30.6 billion in net equityData from December/2216 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM16Our cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM By exercising our active role as associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to make their dreams come true, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond the associates, also improving living conditions in the communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperatives in Brazil, summarizes this view: 17 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 202217 “Not to work just for myself, but for others or for the common good” As can be seen, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. Cooperativism is a business model that contributes to the development of people and the community. Through the virtuous cycle, it promotes the growth of members, encourages new business and promotes new investments.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our incorporation we have kept a close eye on our impacts.

Based on our guidelines, we build the systemic documents and policies that guide our strategy, decision-making, operations and conduct. The Sustainability Policy establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact and reducing our adverse impact. To guide our sustainable development strategy, we have established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.41 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 2022We have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicredi's material themes, that is, the most relevant themes for the Sicredi’s sustainability.

PUFV follows its own methodology, based on the school curriculum, developed through cooperative educational projects. The protagonists of the learning process are the students, who count on the support of educators, parents and the community. We, as a cooperative, believe that in this way we help to build a future with fairer, more supportive people and successful entrepreneurs, who respect diversity and who use dialogue to make life decisions. To achieve the objective of educating children and adolescents within the concepts we believe in Sicredi, PUFV has two basic principles: cooperation and citizenship.65 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 20228,988 students, adolescents and young people, PUFV participants 769 teachers, in 45 schools in 12 municipalities Meeting regional PUFV, held in Francisco Beltrão/PR, was attended by more than 700 education professionals.

The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March 2022 with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year in the range between 4. 25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in the interest rate Interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of reopening on activity economic influence influenced good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and rising prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. 69 SICREDI IGUAÇU PR/SC/SP 2022We believe we can contribute for the development of a more prosperous society We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate.
