ANNEX NOTE CMN Resolution No. 4,970, of November 25, 2021, regulates the authorization processes related to the operation of financial institutions and other institutions regulated by the National Monetary Council. Based on the aforementioned resolution, the This BCB Normative Instruction (IN BCB) is intended to disclose the procedures, documents and information necessary for the preparation of the aforementioned authorization requests. 2. Decree No. 10,411, of June 30, 2020, regulates the carrying out of regulatory impact analysis (RIA) as a prerequisite to the issuance of a normative act. However, in its article 49, the aforementioned decree establishes the hypotheses for exemption from carrying out AIR. This IN BCB fits into the hypothesis set out in item II, as it does not introduce any additional requirements to those contained in the current regulations and is intended to clarify the way in which obligations defined in a hierarchically superior standard are fulfilled. Thus, based on item II of art. 49 of Decree No. 10,411, of 2020, I understand that the publication of this IN BCB eliminates the need for AIR. CAROLINA PANCOTTO BOHRER Boss
