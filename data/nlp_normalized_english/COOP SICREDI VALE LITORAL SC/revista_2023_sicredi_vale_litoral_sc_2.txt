Dear Associates, We have finished our fourth term, that is, 14 years at the helm of the Cooperative. In this last term, 2019 to 2022, we opened nine new branches: Camboriú - Monte Alegre, Navegantes, Itajaí - Limoeiro, Balneário Camboriú - Av. dos Estados, Porto Belo - Perequê, Guabiruba, Tijucas, Indaial, Blumenau - Garcia. We investigated the effects of the Sertão do Trombudo School Cooperative, in Itapema and noticed good results; As a result of this analysis, the cooperative is implementing two more school cooperatives, one in Bombinhas and another in Itajaí, with agreements already signed between the Municipalities and Cooperativa Sicredi Vale Litoral SC. As promised in the 2018 election, we acquired land and built a Headquarters for the Cooperative. The opening probability is scheduled for May of this year, 2023. It will be a milestone in the history of our Cooperative and should generate more trust and credibility and will bring effective results to all of us. In these four years, there has been a growth of more than 30% each year, leaving 5 SICREDI VALE LITORAL SC 2022Cooperative in a privileged and prominent position in the Sicredi System, placing the company among the 20 largest in Central Sicredi South Southeast and, also, in the Brazilian Cooperative System, appearing as one of the seventy largest, fitting it into Porte Grande, with managed assets exceeding three billion reais. Also, in job creation, the cooperative has more than four hundred employees, which highlights it as a major generator of employment and income in the region, being a reference in the communities and attracting people to the cooperative system. In the festivities of 15 years of existence, we have to salute all of our associates, who are largely responsible for the company's prominence in the Litoral and Vales do Tijucas, Mirim and Açu regions. Only everyone's participation could transform the dream of 2008 into this reality of 2023: Fifteen years of existence: a solid company, generating results for its associates, guarantor of growth for the cities in which it operates and, fundamentally, a foundation of credibility and development economic for the entire region. We can affirm, with greatness of spirit: we have fulfilled, so far, our mission, generating development and wealth for our cities: we have grown in asset management; we grew in assets; we grew in the number of agencies; we grew in job and income generation; We have grown in credibility, which is demonstrated by the number of members, exceeding sixty-three thousand members. In this 15-year jubilee year, we want to call on all our associates to participate in the festivities that will be planned by management for this year. After all, we are a cooperative that operates in one of the most promising regions of Santa Catarina and, perhaps, Brazil, that is, a region that brings together more than one million and six hundred thousand people and with a vocation for success and leadership, not to mention that it is a region where cooperativism is active and effective. José Domingos de Andrade Chairman of the Board of Directors 6 MESSAGE FROM THE LEADERSHIPMessage from the Executive Board I speak of gratitude for the opportunity to be at the helm of this cooperative, which even though it is so new - it will complete 15 years in 2023 - already has a significant share in the region's market and is increasingly present in the daily lives of our community. I chose the word pride for being able to look back and realize everything we have achieved in these 15 years. I am sure that, together, we help to build a more prosperous society, whether through our countless social projects, or even through our actions by Hello Associate, It is with a mix of gratitude, pride and confidence that I write this message to our more than 60 thousand associates and 430 employees.7 SICREDI VALE LITORAL SC 2022incentive to the local economy, and even for the active participation of our employees in community. And confidence comes from the certainty that, in these same 15 years, we have built solid foundations to support the growth we have been experiencing in recent years and we aim to continue observing Upcoming. We are structuring ourselves with beautiful and modern agencies, expanding our area of ​​activity and investing heavily in our team of employees. All this combined with another major delivery, scheduled for the first half of 2023, which is the Regional Headquarters of the Cooperative. All these achievements were only possible with the support of the community, our associates, core coordinators, fiscal advisors and management advisors of the Cooperative, in addition to the engagement of our team. Our vision for the next five years is to become the main financial institution for our members. With this in mind, we invested in a training program for our employees, called the Key Program, in which we write down and share with the entire team the four keys that will guarantee our continued success: Security, Relationships, Agility and Efficiency. Each of them carries a little of the culture of Sicredi Vale Litoral SC and the people who built this cooperative. By keeping them on the daily agenda of our agencies, we are convinced that we will continue to fulfill the objectives of creating this cooperative, back in 2008: to provide simple, close and human service to businesspeople and the local community. LONG LIVE SICREDI. LONG LIVE SICREDI VALE LITORAL SC Arão João da Silva Neto Executive Director of Sicredi Vale Litoral SC 8 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM81 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a salary account on a mandatory basis for their employees, in a credit union membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements , where traditional financial institutions see no possibility of profit. This way, each financial product or service that members Hiring in the cooperative brings results to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in the assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM That were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and that govern the cooperatives from all over the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:9 SICREDI VALE LITORAL SC 202295 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the more solid path to generating prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives they promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their 3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to your pocket, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is totally autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve life and collective prosperity, within a context of advancing Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing quality food and essential items at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans got together and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, for Through cooperation and union of efforts, it provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives by understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved.10 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM10Presence in Brazil Learn about some relevant historical facts from our history.
