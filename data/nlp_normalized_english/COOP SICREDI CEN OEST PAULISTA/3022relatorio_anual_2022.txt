It's a pleasure to meet you again, after an intense year of work, on the pages of this report, to "talk" a little about what happened in our year 2022 here, at Sicredi Centro Oeste Pautista. I'll start with one word: Thank you. I appreciate We ask for their cooperation and trust, as only with them was it possible for us to remain steadfast in our purpose: to build, together, a more prosperous community. The year 2022 was a year of great recovery. We were closer to the point of physical view, something that has not happened with such intensity since 2020, when the Coronavirus Pandemic devastated our world. This contact, for us, is unique, since we are digital, as we need to be, but human as we are — and this “human being” is what makes us different, makes us agents of change, makes us cooperatives . Thanks to mutual commitment, we are going through the Covid-19 pandemic, which left marks on our lives and will forever remain in history as a period where we need to reinvent ourselves... and reinvention is in our DNA. Since 1844, when the first modern cooperative emerged in England, the cooperative system has reinvented itself and adapted to the realities of the communities where it is present. Here, we have reinvented ourselves since 1902, when the Swiss priest Theodor Amstad founded the first credit cooperative in Latin America, today one of the Sicredi cooperatives. As a member, you can say that you own a century-old institution, which moves resources, adds income, strengthens the local economy and develops social relations. Be proud, because in December 2022, we will celebrate 120 years of history! Returning to the year 2022, the last of these 120, we can say that we are back with face-to-face training, both for employees — so they can serve you — and for associates. We even launched a free course platform, Sicredi na Comunidade, so that everyone can improve their skills with different courses in various themes. We directly impacted more than 12 thousand people with our financial education workshops and more than 78 thousand others through our content on the topic on social media. In fact, if you don't follow us in the media, I invite you: at the end of this report, you will find the links and QR Codes to connect even more with us. Another initiative that we are proud of is the A Uniao Faz a Vida Program, Sicredi’s main social responsibility initiative. Consolidated in the cities of Dracena, Pompeii — which celebrated 10 years of operation — and since 2019, in the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. In 2022, PUFV arrived in the cities of Bauru, Herculandia, Inlibia Paulista and Marflia. In addition to PUFV, we are proud of the actions taken on the day of cooperation and many others, led by our volunteer movement, which help us build a more just, prosperous and fraternal society. We also opened five new service points, with structures in Agudos and Rancharia, a new building in Pompeia and two business offices in Bauru and Marilia, thinking about giving the best consultancy on the market on the subject of “investments” — and we don't stop there, as we have started work on other structures that should be delivered now, in 2023. All of this made us have a result that exceeded RS 14.7 million. Anyway, I leave you now to enjoy the pages of this report and I close with the same word I started with: Thank you. On behalf of the Board of Directors of Sicredi Centro Oeste Paulista, I would like to thank you for trust, cooperation and, above all, the belief that, together, we can continue writing an even more prosperous history in our community. /1:6 21:11:; Joﬁo Alberto Salvi President Sicredi Centro Oeste Paulista Polovro do Executive Director Carfssimosl And write, for another year, a beautiful story for you and with you. This, which was a year of great challenges, was also full of great achievements and achievements. Here, I highlight some of these, a satisfaction that can constructions, which were only possible through the business we carried out between associates, in our agencies. The first major result that I highlight is the growth in the number of people who walk with us on this journey: more than 45 thousand. Only 50 associates from various cities in our area of ​​activity who, today, trust us with more than RS 12 billion in resources, generating a credit portfolio that exceeds RS 590 million, promoting the Local economy and adding income. All this generates development local, new opportunities and strengthens the financial life of our communities, especially yours, associates. As I mentioned, resources are managed and the results generated are reinvested in society, so that the virtuous cycle is completed and, thus, we all grow together. This is one of the beautiful things that only cooperativism is capable of making happen, or rather, that you, the member, are able to do together with us — and that is what we want to continue building with you in the coming years. Per We are grateful for this, in the certainty that we will continue together, building even more, after all, our job is to think about what is best for you and your financial life, supporting you every day. And if you are not yet a member, you already know: Look for one of our agencies — the addresses are on the next pages or on our website — and become a Sicredi member.
