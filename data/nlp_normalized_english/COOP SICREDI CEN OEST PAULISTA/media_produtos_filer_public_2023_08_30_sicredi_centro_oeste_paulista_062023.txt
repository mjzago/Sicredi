Operations with fixed rates are recorded at redemption value, and the income and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities. Revenues and expenses of a financial nature are accounted for on a pro-rata basis and calculated based on the exponential model, except those relating to discounted securities or related to foreign operations, which are calculated based on the linear method. Operations with post-fixed rates or indexed to foreign currencies are updated to date of the balance.

When this is the case, the recoverable value is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use of an asset. n) Deposits, loan obligations and transfers are demonstrated by the amounts of liabilities, considering charges, exchange rate and monetary variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro-rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of amounts whose availability is immediate to associated, therefore, there is no set deadline for moving them, leaving it at the discretion of the resource holder to do so according to their needs.
