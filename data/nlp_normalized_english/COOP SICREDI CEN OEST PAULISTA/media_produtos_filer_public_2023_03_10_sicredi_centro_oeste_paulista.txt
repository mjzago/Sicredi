Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Report management and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. ,4 EY Building a better working world In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to review the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If with Based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the board and governance for financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the statements financial, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken together, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: o We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than the risk arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. / Building a better working world We gained understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on the evidence audit results obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding this, including other aspects, the planned scope, the time of the audit and the significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in the internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasilia, March 8, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP—O15199/F VI‘ V! Y,’ ‘(‘t. »r,:.‘,;,,( Renata Zanotta Calgada V Contadora CRC—RSO62793/0-8 Administragiio Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, the starting from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the cycle of rising global interest rates. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Bank US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50% , and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, the data of inflation already point to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.7% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advance in the services sectors. However, economic activity has already shown signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and rising prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortia, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, legal entities and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, We highlight the following administrative facts: start of activities with the new agency in the municipality of Rancharia. The reopening of the branch in the city of Pompéia, with more modern facilities that will provide better service conditions for our members. Implementation of a self-service kiosk in the city of Agudos, to serve members in this location who do not yet have a physical branch, and also to facilitate the prospecting of new members in the County. Two investment offices were opened, one in the city of Marilia and the other in the city of Bauru, with the aim of offering exclusive service to members regarding their investments. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: 0 Women and Youth Committees: we seek to promote diversity and training new leaders for cooperativism, our committees bring strength to these initiatives in all regions where we operate. At the cooperative, we offer training in Mindset Change and Purposefulness for all members, guided by the Lumem consultancy, and we guarantee the presence of committee representatives at the Youth and Women Summits, promoted by Central PR/SP/RJ. The Belonging Program: we seek to engage members, establish the rules of participation and guide the model of participatory management, encouraging participation in assemblies and decision-making processes. In 2022, the cooperative reached 12.25% of its membership's participation in the Assembly Process, increasing by 4.25% from 2021 to 2022. At the Delegates' Assembly, we brought together 100% of member representatives. This year, members elected the members of the Board of Directors, and their AGM was approved by BACEN. The Union makes Life Program: we seek to promote the values ​​of cooperation and citizenship among children and adolescents. In 26 years of existence, the program has already impacted more than 3.7 million children and adolescents in S20 municipalities. In the cooperative, we launched PUFV in the municipal networks of Herculandia and Indbia Paulista and made a cooperation agreement with Sagrado-Rede de Educacao, for implementation at Colégios Sao Jose and Sao Francisco (Bauru) and Colégio Sagrado Coracao de Jesus (Marilia). We maintained partnerships with the already established municipalities of Pompeii (10 years of activities) and Dracena (6 years of activities). In total, we have more than 800 teachers involved, 18 schools and more than 5 thousand children. The Crescer Program: we seek to promote a greater understanding of credit cooperative societies among members and future members. In the cooperative, the Program is already solidified and participation is growing every year. In 2022, we reached more than 900 associates who specialized in cooperative training in all branches of the cooperative. In addition to offering training, we monitor participants' ISA and MC to measure each member's understanding of their cooperative business. Recognitions For over 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Economico, Best Companies to Work For, from Voce S/A Magazine, rankings from Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate assessment raised by Moody's. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles evaluated by the risk classification agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in terms of physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue building a more prosperous society.
