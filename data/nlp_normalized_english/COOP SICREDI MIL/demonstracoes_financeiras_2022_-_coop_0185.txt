Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Code of Ethics Professional Accountant and professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the management report. Our Opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. 2- EY Building a better working world In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to review the management report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, in otherwise, it appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its continuity operational and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but it is not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions.

If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. o We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of adequate presentation.

Brasilia, March 9, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP—0‘l5199/F l /1/' il\"A“l‘.i:“/,‘,X Renata Zanotta Calgzada Accountant CRC-RS062793/O-8 Accministragio Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it It remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our founding. This is due to through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a stance monetary squeeze, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (0 Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March of this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. At the Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.7% per year. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advance of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of the restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, legal entities and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participation in the results and decisions of cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlighted the following administrative facts: This year, thinking about maintaining proximity to the public in our segment, we created a line of credit with special conditions for employees who joined the Military Fire Brigade and Fire Brigade corporation, with the aim of it helps them in the initial months of the course, where they have a period of 60 days until they receive their first salary. We also have focused on promoting the line of credit for financing solar energy, thinking about the economic sustainability of members and in relation to the level of debt of our public, which was strongly affected by the pandemic, we created a credit recovery committee that analyzes renegotiations with term and differentiated rates, with the aim of ensuring the continued financial health of these people. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact on the regions where we operate 550 premises since our founding. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: This year we continued the work of multiplying financial education for employees of the Military Brigade and Military Fire Brigade of RS, through lectures given in the ESFES training course (School of Training and Improvement of Sergeants of the Military Brigade of RS), PAEC — BM (Plan Anula de Educagéo Continua) and throughout Porto Alegre and the region Metropolitan, through invitations we received from the battalion commanders to give the lecture to the brigadiers and firefighters of the battalion. This year we also sponsored the production of comic books developed by the CBM (Military Fire Department) for a project to raise awareness of domestic accidents involving children in the state's public education network. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Best and Biggest, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econémico, Best Companies to Work For, from Vocé S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had our corporate rating upgraded by Moody's. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk classification agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same magazine that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continued work. Together we will continue building a more prosperous society.
