Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative Sicredi Evolution Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Sicredi Confederation Accounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendency of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 Independent auditor's report on the financial statements To the Administrators, Advisors and Members of the Credit, Savings Cooperative and Investment Sicredi Evolution João Pessoa - PB Opinion We examined the financial statements of the Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Sicredi Evolucion (“Cooperative”) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present adequately, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report to this respect.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 Conjunto A - Bloco A 1st floor - room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF - Brazil Tel: +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.brResponsibilities of the board and governance for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from misstatement material, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions made based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute procedures audit in response to such risks, as well as obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures audit appropriate to the circumstances, but not with the objective of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, events or conditions Future risks may lead to the Cooperative no longer remaining in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and findings significant audit issues, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasília, February 23, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through vote. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This happens through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperation, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its high interest rate cycle in March of this year with the fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4. 50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of assets at risk in the market and the increased prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. Separately, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% At the time of October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We entered into a strategic union with Sicredi Piauí, strengthening the bonds of union and expanding our area of ​​action to the already 173 municipalities in Paraíba plus 224 cities in the State of Piauí. With this, we carried out the entire incorporation process, which includes holding a Joint Meeting and migrating accounts. The result was the composition of an even stronger Sicredi Evolution. We expanded our service network with the opening of two new branches, in the cities of Monteiro – PB and Bananeiras PB. With regard to reforms, we renewed the Hospital Unimed Agency with the Sicredi standard layout and, at Agência Campina Grande, we renovated the environments and installed a coworking space with a cafeteria. Regarding non-financial products, we promoted an internal campaign and achieved spectacular numbers in savings, consortia and debt insurance products. To promote our products, we were present at important business events in Paraíba. To promote our brand, we installed a personalized Sicredi watch in the cities of Guarabira, Bananeiras and Itabaiana in Paraiba. Systematically, we implemented Homebroker Sicredi, Appley Pay, the recurring pix and we piloted Shopping Sicredi. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: •Youth Committee: We implemented the Youth Committee in 2022, reaffirming the commitment to shape young leaders, with the first meeting held with leaders together with Fundação Sicredi aiming to align the understanding and objectives of the aforementioned committee. •Sustainability Committee: Implemented in 2022 following recommendations from the Sicredi Foundation, the Committee created an action plan aimed at improving the indicators of the Cooperative's Sustainability R eference. •Grow Program: We had 26 classes in the Grow Program, training associates and employees. All agencies and cities hold the grow meeting, where Associates go through training understanding a little more about cooperativism and cooperatives. Regarding training for employees, we carry out recycling with the program's multipliers every two months, and training with new employees every six months. •Solidarity actions: This year we held DIA C with the action entitled “Cooperation in the square” and a very coordinated work, social actions were carried out in all cities where the Cooperative has an agency: João Pessoa, Campina Grande, Patos, Cabedelo, Santa Rita, Mamanguape, Monteiro, Sapé, Gu arabira, Solânea and Bananeiras, including activities such as measuring blood pressure, blood glucose testing, vaccination against Covid, financial education for children and adolescents, kids space, cutting hairdressing, gymnastics classes, donation of basic baskets, donation of wheelchairs, etc. The activities took place free of charge and were open to the community and impacted around 1,500 people. Christmas + Solidarity: social action important at the end of the year, with donations and activities that contribute to a better world. In 2022 we had donations of gifts and/or school supplies for children and donations of food and/or hygiene kits to welfare institutions, carried out in all cities where we have physical branches, both in Paraíba and also in Piauí. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, fromValor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had a corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil for physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.

Another important action was the trip coordinators to Porto Alegre to get to know the Sicredi Foundation, the Administrative Center and Sicredi Pioneira, enabling them to gain greater knowledge about the history of cooperativism.

Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative events. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and CSLL is 16%, in compliance with Provisional Measure No. 1,115, published on April 29, 2022, which increased the rate by one percentage point and taking effect during the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
