Savings deposits are made up of amounts the availability of which can be freely moved, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes.

The obligations for loans and transfers correspond to the resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions for the purpose of financing operations. Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable value is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount in which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset.h) Non-financial assets held for sale Corresponds to rights that have as their object tangible assets intended for the maintenance of activities or exercised for this purpose.

ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/FOur opinion on the statements financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. Basis for opinion Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those with responsibility for supervising the management process preparation of financial statements. Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to support our opinion. The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements - We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead to Cooperative no longer maintains operational continuity. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ending on that date. , in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. We have examined the financial statements of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Sicredi Evolucion (“Cooperative”), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, of the result comprehensive, changes in net equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main policies accounting. The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. As part of the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: - We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. Opinion - We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no alternative realistic to avoid the closure of operations. - We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. - We gained an understanding of the controls internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. Brasília, February 23, 2023. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in controls that we identiﬁed during our work.
