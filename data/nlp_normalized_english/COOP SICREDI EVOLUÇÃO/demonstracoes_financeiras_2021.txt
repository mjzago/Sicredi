NOTE 01 – OPERATIONAL CONTEXT (a) Income from intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council - CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil - BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20, which regulated procedures for preparing and disclosing financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Laws No. 4,595/64 and No. 5,764/71, with amendments by Complementary Law No. 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Among the normative changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way of presenting statements of surplus or losses. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to surpluses or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other operating income and revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. extrajudicial assistance from an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity operations with these institutions. The Cooperative is also an integral part of Sicredi Fundos Garantidores, a non-profit company whose reserve formation comes from monthly and extraordinary contributions from cooperatives associated with the fund, which aims to ensure the credibility and solvency of its members. According to the rules established in the Guarantee Fund Regulations, monthly contributions are calculated by the sum of two installments: ﬁxed installment, related to the objective of each Fund; and variable portion, relating to the risk attributed to the System (considers levels of liquidity, capital margin and use of security devices). The reclassified values ​​are shown in the table below: Management is restating the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: In 2021, it was carried out to reclassification of inflows from intercooperative deposits, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centrals via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate.(b) Non-operational resultNOTE 02 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income and expenditure, as well as revenue and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the accrual basis, which establishes that inflows and expenditures and revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of results for the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they correlate, regardless of receipt or payment, allocated proportionally in accordance with the amounts of gross income from a cooperative act and gross revenue from a non-cooperative act, when not identified with each activity. About the results of possible operations carried out with non-cooperative members (non-cooperative act) the taxes due are determined and collected. The results of these operations are taken to the account of the Technical, Educational and Social Assistance Fund - FATES, as provided for in Law No. 5,764/71. In the year ending December 31, 2021, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ (1,557) (2020 - R$ (783)) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts. b) Cash and cash equivalentsNOTE 03 – SUMMARY OF MAIN PRACTICES g) Provision for expected losses associated with credit riskThese are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to Management's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697 /00 of the CMN. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is recorded in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day, in unearned income. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, after which they are written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in clearing accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet.d) Securities f) Credit operationsThe main accounting practices adopted to prepare the financial statements were: a) Calculation of the result Cash and cash equivalents are represented by cash and cash equivalents, by the amounts invested by the Cooperatives in the Centrals via Financial Centralization and by the shares of fixed income and multimarket funds, whose operations maturity on the date of effective application is equal to or less than 90 days and present an insignificant risk of change in fair value. Authorization to complete these financial statements was granted by the Board of Directors on 23 February 2022. c) Interbank liquidity applications The portfolio is made up of fixed income securities, variable income securities and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to their respective market values, as applicable. e) Interﬁnancial relations – ﬁnancial centralization Financial centralization comprises the cooperative’s cash surpluses not invested in its activities, which are centralized through interﬁnancial transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. They represent operations at fixed prices referring to the purchase of securities with resale commitment and investments in interbank deposits and are demonstrated at redemption value, net of income to be appropriated corresponding to future periods. The provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria deﬁned by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25 , issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely:• Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, final and unappealable. Contingent assets with probable successes are only disclosed in an explanatory note; • Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed;• Legal obligations are recorded as due, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or furthermore, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated for check for loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset. Non-financial assets held for sale, determined by CMN Resolution No. 4,747/19, are segregated into own and received from third parties. These assets do not depreciate and are measured at fair value in accordance with the criteria established by CPC 46, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,748/19.• Own: represent assets owned by the cooperative which are not used in the performance of social activity, are available for immediate sale and whose disposal is highly probable within a maximum period of one year.• Received from third parties: represent goods received as a gift in payment of debts, not intended for personal use. n) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current)j) Investmentsi) Other assets current and realizable in the long term (non-current) Corresponds to rights that have as their object tangible assets intended for the maintenance of activities or exercised for this purpose.

Accumulated amortizations, calculated from the moment they begin to be enjoyed the respective benefits, at a rate of 10% to 20% per year, using the straight-line method. m) Reduction in the recoverable value of assetsStated at acquisition cost, including, when applicable, income earned and pro-rata die monetary variations incurred and exchange rate variations, deducted from the corresponding provisions for losses or adjustment to market value and rental income appropriate. o) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Profit Net (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ, which is 15%, plus an additional 10% and CSLL, in which the rate went from 15% to 20% from July 2021 and will return to 15% from January 2022, applied to the profit earned, after the calculation base adjustments provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation base from previous years, being This deduction is limited to 30% of taxable income.

Porto Alegre, February 25, 2022 - We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in in relation to the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain its in operational continuity.Basis for opinion The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error.

We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and We comply with our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards.

Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain its in operational continuity.Basis for opinion The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Sicredi Evolucion - Sicredi Evolucion on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and We comply with our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to substantiate our opinion. Opinion We have examined the ﬁnancial statements of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Sicredi Evolucion - Sicredi Evolucion (“Cooperativa”), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and the respective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in the net equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding explanatory notes, including a summary of the main accounting policies. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding values ​​We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the values ​​corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of tickets from intercooperative deposits for financial intermediation income, due to the nature of the operations, and (ii) non-operating income balances for the groups of other operating income and income and other operational expenditures and expenses, due to the nature of the operations.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the management are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from misstatement material, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they may influence, within from a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements.
