CPR operations are carried out with members as long as they are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee. The joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system are considered to define a single spread for all counterparties. NOTE 07 – CREDIT OPERATIONS A credit portfolio is composed and classiﬁed as follows: a) Composition of the credit portfolio by type of operation and terms: DI applications between Banco Sicredi and the Cooperative are carried out to cover advances on receivables in the acquisition and INSS payroll operations , both carried out by members, with a remuneration rate of 105% and 100% of the CDI, respectively. NOTE 06 – SECURITIES AND SECURITIES Securities and credits receivable refer to amounts receivable from associated with card transactions carried out in the interest-free credit modality. d) Concentration of credit operationsb) Composition of the credit portfolio by risk levels c) Composition of the credit portfolio segregated by sector of activity and maturity ranges The Cooperative also has Co-obligations in guarantees provided in the amount of R$ 10,890 (December 2020 - R$ 3,846) which includes operations with resources received from financial institutions and transferred to members via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor under a contract signed between the parties (Note 26).

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF REAIS) They are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to Management's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in Resolutions no. 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is recorded in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day, in unearned income. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, after which they are written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in memorandum accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. g) Provision for expected losses associated with the credit riskf) Credit operationsFinancial centralization comprises the cooperative's surplus cash not invested in its activities, which are centralized through interﬁnancial transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or loaned to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. The provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of the The reclassiﬁed values ​​are shown in the table below: Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which the statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to surpluses or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into groups of accounts of other operating income and revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses, for the purpose of favoring the comparability of the financial statements. Authorization to complete these financial statements was granted by the Board of Directors on February 23, 2022. NOTE 02 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The main accounting practices adopted to prepare the financial statements were: d) Securities In 2021, it was the reclassification of inflows from intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation the values raised in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centrals via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classiﬁcation is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operational result The purpose of FGCoop is to provide credit guarantees in cases of intervention or settlement extrajudicial from an associated institution, up to the limit of R$ 250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity operations with these institutions.

The results of any operations carried out with non-cooperative members (non-cooperative act) are determined and the taxes due are collected.
