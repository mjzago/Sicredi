Future openings in the Capital on Avenida Rachid Neder, and in the interior, in the municipality of Rio Negro, these members are already being served, respectively at the Campo Grande and Corguinho branches. Financial Education, Credit Recovery and Promotion Campaign: The Cooperative implemented a credit recovery campaign starting from October to December 2022, with attractive rates and terms and easy entry. They were instituted special credit lines: photovoltaic energy financing; promotional credit aimed at women called <Pink October=, and aimed at men, <Blue November=. For companies managed by women, a special line of credit was created with different terms. Aiming to better serve rural credit, a fundraising campaign was carried out via LCA, in the period May/November 2022. In the period between August 1st and November 30th, 2022, it was a campaign was carried out to increase private pensions. Agility in service: We completed the centralization of the analysis for granting rural credit at the cooperative's headquarters. We adopted the digital signature system to authorize the write-off of LIENS. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. We have grown in the number of associates and people in the community impacted by the social programs of Cooperativa Sicredi Campo Grande. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey has completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our founding. This happens through initiatives that deliver a relationship differentiated, cooperative, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. O The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of reduced growth worldwide. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began in beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the The effect of reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October. , on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and household debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. We have grown in the number of members and people in the community impacted by the social programs of Cooperativa Sicredi Campo Grande. Below, we list some initiatives carried out in 20 22: Women's Committee – After a break due to the pandemic period, Sicredi Campo Grande resumed the Women's Committee Program, whose objective is to develop female leaders within the cooperative, promoting gender equality, reinforcing the commitment that the System has as a signatory to the UN Global Compact for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals; the Women's Committee is linked to SDG 5, <gender equality=.

Today, 26 women are part of the Program which, in 2022, promoted training meetings, election for new coordination, the members also participated in the 1st Women's SUMMIT of Central BRC, held in October 2022, in Campo Grande. And, closing the year, the Women's Committee promoted a voluntary Christmas action at the Home for the Elderly, bringing positive energy, snacks, gifts and, of course, lots of joy to its residents. Crescer Program – As a growth program relationship with members, Crescer promotes knowledge and encourages their participation in the day-to-day running of the cooperative. In 2022, more than 1,600 people participated in the Program's awareness raising activities and thus, we brought the cooperative culture to more people, stimulating knowledge about credit cooperative societies and Sicredi; Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis – “Cooperate for a sustainable financial life”.

X - Information security risk 781-72I) Implementation Plan for accounting regulations established by CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021 On November 25, 2021, CMN Resolution No. 4,966 /21 was published, which provides for the applicable accounting concepts and criteria to financial instruments, as well as for the designation and recognition of protection relationships (hedge accounting) by financial institutions and other institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil, converging with the main concepts of the international standard IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments . The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a counterpart to the surplus or accumulated losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the plan implementation of said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the case of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution no. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan.
