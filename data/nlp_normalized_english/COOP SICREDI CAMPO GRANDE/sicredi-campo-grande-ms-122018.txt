Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with ethical principles relevant provisions set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the management report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. : +55 51 3204-5500 ey.com.brEY|2In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the management report and, in doing so, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by BACEN and for the internal controls that it determined to be necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless management intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations.

Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian standards and international auditing, always detects any relevant distortions that exist. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and we maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: · We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, since the Fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation.EY|3 · We obtain an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative’s internal controls. · We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management. · We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and findings significant audit issues, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work.
