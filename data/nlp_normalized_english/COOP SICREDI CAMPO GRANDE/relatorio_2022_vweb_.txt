Dear Members, We are a Cooperative Credit System present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, we have reached the mark of 6.5 million members, a growth of 15% in the last year. Today we have more than 2,400 branches across the country and in 200 municipalities, we are the only financial institution. What does this mean? Like the Central Bank itself has announced on many occasions, credit cooperatives will be largely responsible for providing access to banking services for the population, especially those who need it most. We have a lot to celebrate, especially because our Cooperativa Sicredi Campo Grande MS has evolved along with the System, growing both in assets and in the number of members. We reached the mark of 70 thousand members, this means many more people united for the development of Credit Cooperatives, demonstrating the trust placed in this business model. We started 2023 on the right foot, opening the Rachid Neder agency, in the São Francisco neighborhood, making it the 18th agency of our Cooperative. Also this year, we will reopen the Coronel Antonino agency, with modern and innovative structure, facilities, everything to give associates a good experience and comfort. We are going against what the banking market has been doing, closing branches and service points. Assemblies 2023 A Assembly is the high point of cooperativism, it is through it that the member can monitor and deliberate on the balance sheet, the numbers of the Cooperative, the growth in the number of members, the results and how they will be distributed. It is you who decides, which is why your participation is so important. It is the moment when all members are called upon to participate through voting, to decide the direction that our cooperative should follow. In 2022, we had the participation of more 14% of the total number of members, in our Nucleus Assembly, interacting in the chat, answering questions, making suggestions on topics of interest to our business and voting. This year, as a novelty, we will present a thematic Assembly, choosing the theme focused on ESG, which brings together environmental policies, social responsibility and governance. It is our ECOS Assembly, following the tripod of sustainability: Economic, Ecological and Social. We will present some achievements of Sicredi System in this context, as well as the results of the social responsibility actions achieved in 2022. Come, the ECOS Assembly is coming! Participate through the Assemblies Sicredi platform, from March 20th to 24th. Wardes A. Conte Lemos President In 2022, Sicr edi completed 1 20 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origin happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amst and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. Theodor Amst was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In New Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining through time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promoting quality of life. 905Cooperativism 120 years of Sicr edi120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM 06Timeline Discover some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Establishment of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, current Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System that imposed normative restrictions on the functioning of credit cooperatives.1971 Law No. 5,764/71 was sanctioned, which deﬁned the legal regime of cooperative societies.1988 New C onstitution favorable regulatory conditions to credit cooperatives.

Find out more about our history in the publication A Trajetória do Sicr edi: https://www.sicredi.com.br /trajetoria/ 07 Sicredi Campo Grande MS | Annual Report 202208120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM 1Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a mandatory salary account to their employees, in a credit cooperative the agreement happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 6Intercooperation cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members.7Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements , where traditional financial institutions see no possibility of profit. This way, each product or financial service that members contract in the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in the assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM That were born with The Rochdale Pioneers, which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:13135Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid path to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, Cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperative Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Grow and Cooperation at Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their 3Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4Autonomy and independence The cooperative is totally autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism did not emerge in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who seek to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within the of a context of advancing Industrial R evolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans got together and founded the Society of Pioneering Provosts of R ochdale ( R ochdale Quitable Pioneer's Society Limited). Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped to open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where the responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of R ochdale set sail history of Cooperatives by understanding what values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved.
