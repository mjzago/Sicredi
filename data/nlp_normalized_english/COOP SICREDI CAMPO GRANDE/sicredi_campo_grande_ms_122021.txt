NOTE 02 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (c) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which the statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction work or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into account groups of other operating income and income and other operating expenditure and expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements.

The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties resulting from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with the internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's staff; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on the Institution's risk and control culture; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of activities of the institution and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to assess, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Business Continuity RiskI - Capital Management Structure For the purposes of legislation In force, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital held by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the extent of exposure to the System's risk. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. The processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. You processes for capital management in the Sicredi System include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above the minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risk appetite, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and sustainable manner. efficient; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors; #The Business Continuity Management system structured in Sicredi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and IT disaster recovery strategies; • Operational and IT continuity plans.

IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in market values deposits held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variations, interest rates, share prices and commodity prices. Market risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure.

Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the institution's main business processes as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the business continuity strategies adopted are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard set out the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the entities' most critical processes.

For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: •The possibility the institution will not be able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the commitment of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring significant losses; and •The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market.
