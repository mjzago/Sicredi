If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the fair presentation objective. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and of significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

IV - Liquidity Risk Understanding Liquidity Risk is essential for the sustainability of institutions that operate in the financial and capital markets and is associated with the institution's ability to finance commitments acquired at reasonable market prices and carry out its business plans with stable sources of financing. For this effect, liquidity risk is defined as: •The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the commitment of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring significant losses; and •The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate the market price of a position, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market. Liquidity risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the scale of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support System entities in managing liquidity risk.
