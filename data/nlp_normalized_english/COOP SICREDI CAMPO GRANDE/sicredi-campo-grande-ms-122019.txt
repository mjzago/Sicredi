In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento de Campo Grande and Region - Sicredi Campo Grand and MS on December 31, 2019, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank do Brasil - BACEN. Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to substantiate our opinion. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The management of the Cooperative is responsible for this other information that comprises the management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management's report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management's report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated . If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the management report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. One company - member of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined were necessary to allow the preparation of demonstrate financial actions free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless the administration intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of if caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or collectively, they may influence, from a perspective reasonable, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute procedures audit in response to such risks, as well as obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. • We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures audit appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management. 3 • We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, the timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work.

Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions, which aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Assessment of risks and controls; • Documentation and storage of the database losses; • Business continuity management. III - Market RiskI - Capital Management Structure For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital maintained by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the extent of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. Processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria established by current regulations, aligned with best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risky appetite, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors;NOTE 23 – MANAGEMENT RISKS The Sicredi System considers risk management to be a priority in the conduct of its business activities, adopting practices in absolute accordance with the precepts of the Basel Accords. In this way, it has specialized areas for managing these risks, centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A.
