Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP 11O SICREDI 1. Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities as members, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination. 2. Democratic management Cooperatives are democratic organizations, controlled by their members, who actively participate in the formulation of their policies and decision-making. Men and women, elected as representatives of the other members, are responsible to them. In first-degree cooperatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote); higher grade cooperatives they are also organized in a democratic manner.3. Economic participation of members Contributions are made equally to the capital of the cooperatives and control is carried out democratically. Part of this capital is normally common property of the cooperative (called the Reserve Fund). Members can receive, if there are economic and financial conditions to do so, a remuneration on the paid-in capital, called interest on share capital. You surpluses are destined for one or more of the following purposes: development of the cooperative, enabling the formation of reserves, partly indivisible; return to members in proportion to their transactions with cooperatives and support for other activities that are approved by members.4. Autonomy and independence Cooperatives are autonomous mutual aid organizations. Even when they enter into an operational agreement with other entities, including governmental ones, they must do so in terms that preserve their democratic control by the partners and maintain their autonomy.Putting the principles of cooperativism into practice The seven principles of cooperativism, which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, they have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) in 1995. The principles of cooperativism direct and support us in generating positive impact: Semiannual Report 2023. Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP 12THE SICREDI VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM By exercising our active role as associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. This way, the money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities.5. Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e C ooperação Program in Ponta do Lápis, which develops cooperative citizens engaged in the development of their community. 6. Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicr edi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members and to society. 7. Interest in the community Credit cooperatives may be located in regions with low levels of economic and social development, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. The vision of the cooperative institution is not profit, but development. In this way, each product or financial service that members contract in the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth for the region. 2023 Semi-Annual Report.

This is exactly how the distribution of results in a Credit Union works. This process is one of the great benefits and differentiators of becoming a business owner. We ended 2022 with a result of R$72.5 million, of which R$332 million in equity, R$1.9 billion in funding resources and R$3.6 in managed resources. The distribution of results was directly into the member's capital account, as defined in the meeting, and in proportion to the services and values ​​contracted and used. The logic is simple: whoever used the services more contributed more to obtaining this result. So, it makes sense for the associate to also have a greater share. 2023 Semi-Annual Report.

Our Cooper is active in agribusinessAGRIBUSINESS Half-yearly Report 2023. Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP 43The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the economy and depends on adequate financial investments to boost its growth and productivity. During the first half of the year, agribusiness faced some signiﬁcant challenges. The volatility of commodity prices, exchange rate fluctuations and Adverse weather conditions were factors that impacted agricultural activities. However, despite these obstacles, the sector has shown resilience and adaptability. We have our origin and roots in agriculture, thus, we play a fundamental role in sustaining the sector, offering personalized financial solutions, such as investment credit lines, financing for the acquisition of agricultural machinery and financing of harvest. Technological advances, such as the use of precision agriculture and artificial intelligence, also have the potential to boost efficiency and productivity in agricultural activities. In view of this, we position ourselves as partners for financing drones and other technological equipment that help in the daily lives of rural producers. We will continue to drive growth in the agricultural sector and contribute to the economy as a whole.

Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP 44In order to mitigate the risk of financial losses resulting from fraud through forgery and manipulation of identification documents of individuals, We implemented a tool to validate the authenticity of these documents, ensuring greater security and efficiency in our Cooperative's account opening flows. This process consists of a thorough forensic analysis verifying whether a document was in fact produced (or at least issued) by the person, body, company or entity to which it is attributed, whether it underwent any changes after it was ready or even whether it was assembled. Forensic analyzes are carried out by a team of specialists in document copying, certiﬁed by the Febraban Institute. In the 1st half of 2023 alone, more than 7,000 identification documents (RG, CNH) have already been validated. Mitigating the risk of opening accounts avoids several hassles when the real owner of the documents is identified. With our work always guided by the search for continuous improvement, during the 1st half of 2023, several internal processes of the Cooperative were reviewed. Through these reviews, it was possible update internal control procedures by applying the Risk-Based Approach (ABR) methodology, which consists of implementing more robust controls in higher risk processes, but also allows the implementation of milder internal controls in lower risk processes. During the 1st half of 2023, with the implementation of internal controls through ABR, we obtained a reduction of more than 40,000 (forty thousand) activities to be performed, in this way generating a gain in operational and financial efficiency, without losing security in our processes.

The training was carried out by the Brazilian Institute for the Prevention of Money Laundering, aimed at understanding the responsibilities of the financial agent and interpreting the PLDFT legislation as a basis for taking decision. The actions carried out in the 1st half of 2023 aim to add value to stakeholders, employees, associates and the community where we are located inserted.
