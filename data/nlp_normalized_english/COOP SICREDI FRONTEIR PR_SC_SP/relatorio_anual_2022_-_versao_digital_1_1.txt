Since January, we have been looking for have greater proximity to agencies in each municipality, as well as leaders and associates. After all, people are our Cooperative’s greatest support link. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I emphasize our commitment to the growth of the Cooperative in economic, social, educational, environmental and cultural terms. For this to become effective, we seek to improve our strategic planning. In this movement, we aim to reach new heights for C ooperative.Planning is the guide for the path we will follow to be among the 30 largest cooperatives in the country by 2026, however, the paving of this path will be carried out by all of us. This will bring you, as a member, an even better experience with Sicr edi F ronteir as PR/SC/SP.COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022José Cesar Wünsch President 5Adverse weather conditions at decisive moments of the 2021/2022 harvest were reason for concern for producers, however, they were able to count on us to navigate this delicate moment. I proudly want to thank our team of collaborators, who worked during 2022 in connection with the planning we created until 2030, with the aim of building a more prosperous society together. For this to happen, the C ooperative continued to invest in the continued training of employees, members of the Board of Directors, Supervisory Board, Board of Directors, Committee Young, Women and Sustainability, as well as our more than 87 thousand members, through various lectures and lives that we make available on YouTube. Finally, I would like to thank the Board of Directors, as well as the Supervisor, Executive Board, Core Coordinators, employees, suppliers and associates for the excellent year that we built together. I wish you a pleasant, uncomplicated and light reading of this report that was created by several hands, to present, with transparency, our growth in numbers and the main actions of your Cooperative. PREFACE Message from the Executive Director We experienced a very challenging year in the economic field. With Brazilians unable to carry out their duties, several found themselves unable to fulfill their budget projects, thus needing some type of assistance. Our Cooperative has always valued the financial lives of its members and especially at this time, We invest even more of our time to offer our associates the most appropriate solution to help them get through this moment of adversity. I consider that the performance and development of an organization depends on three factors: An adequate strategy, which is measurable, feasible and auditable; organized processes, representing support and security in the development of the strategy; and qualified and motivated people, because the secret of the strategy is directly linked to the execution, and we know that everything happens through people. Through quality management, we were able to provide space for teams to work with protagonism, which resulted in the generation of results.COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022Fábio Júnior Câmer to Executive DirectorThis was a year of a lot of learning, achievements and development of innovative actions. 7We are present in agencies and also in the community to increase proximity to people, especially you, our associates, who will always be treated in a humane way. We want you to realize at every meeting that you have a voice and a place in this Cooperative in which you are the owners. Sicredi Fronteiras' sustainable practices are known externally to the organization. To ﬁrm our responsibility with the pillar of sustainability, which balances the economic, social and environmental aspects through the concepts of ESG management (an acronym in English, which means environmental, social and governance, and corresponds to the environmental, social and governance practices of an organization) we created the Sustainability Committee in our Cooperative. We work towards the development of local leaders, through the Youth Committee and the Women's Committee, providing lectures, courses and training with the aim of seeing this group even more active and prepared to take on positions and make decisions, inside and outside Sicredi Fronteiras. The appointment that guides us until 2030 makes us value relationships and member-centeredness even more. How are we doing this? Offering financial and non-financial products and services, in order to achieve the purpose of building a more prosperous society together. I close by thanking the President, our Board of Directors, Board of Directors, Supervisor, Core Coordinators, employees, suppliers and associates, for everything we have achieved. After all, You don't build anything alone. Everything is constituted with the help of people and for people.8120 YEARS OF SICREDI ______________________________10 Timeline __________________________________12 THE 7 PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM _____________18 The Pioneers of Rochdale _________________________19 Our cooperative essence _____________________2001 120 years of Cooperativism120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM 120 years of Sicr ediCooperativism: In 2022, Sicredi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins came with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants , small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. We have more than 6 million membersWe have more than 35 thousand employees We have more than 2,400 agencies 10Daiane W esseler Alexandre Cooperative Development Advisor Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova P etropolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put into practice this collective vision for the construction of a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining through time the purpose of adding income through investments and resources shared, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promotion of quality of life. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022Father Theodor Amstad had an important role in the construction of cooperativism in Brazil. Amstad created one of the largest development movements in history, helping communities, educating people, founding cities and helping families. Father Theodor left in the wake of his life many works and initiatives of relevance social and community impact, always proposing as a condition for the success of actions, learning, protagonism and growth in solidarity and cooperation. 11120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM Timeline Discover some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law n0 4,595/64, which imposed restrictions regulations governing the operation of credit cooperatives. 1971 Law No. 5,764/71 was sanctioned, which deﬁned the legal regime for cooperative societies. 1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.

While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offer a mandatory salary account to their employees, in a credit cooperative the agreement happens differently. After the presentation on how Cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. S icredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities of improvements social, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as the election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact: 1813135 Education, training and information A education, training and information for associates is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperative Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Grow and Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their 3 Economic participation of the members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is totally autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advancement of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and Other craftsmen got together and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneer Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped to open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. Rochdale's pioneers marked the history of Cooperatives by understanding what values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for all those involved. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 19120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM Our cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM When we exercise Our active role as associates, acting as business owners, makes everyone's financial life more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes an offer of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having in its roots, the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: 20“Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good” As you can see, solidarity and Responsibility for society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022José Carlos Steffen Business DirectorThe collaboration of people, united through a common interest, is the key concept of cooperativism, being an organization where everyone owns their own business, and an environment in which the priority is people. The great difference of cooperativism is that it offers the possibility for producers, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders to join large production chains, participating in the globalization of markets. 21We have 41 Agencies SICREDI FRONTEIRAS NUMBERS Serving more than 87,000 Members Distributed in 57 Municipalities 22 Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP _______________________24 Growth and expansion of the Cooperative ____________25 HIGHLIGHTS 2022 ______________________________________3102 Our Cooperative Regional Operation ________________________________27 INITIATIVES 2022 ___________________________________34 WINNERS 2022 ________________________________36Timeline __________________________________28OUR COOPERATIVA Sicredi Fronteiras PR/SC/SP Mission As a cooperative system, value relationships, offer ﬁnancial solutions to add income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society .

The Santo Antonio do Sudoeste agency came first among medium-sized agencies, with the Real Blick Project. This project has been developed since 2019 at Escola Municipal Guilherme Blick, with students from the first to the fifth year. We believe it is crucial to raise children's awareness about the conscious use of money, in order to establish a good relationship with finances from an early age, ensuring a healthy economic life. The project works on financial education through the administration of fictitious money, the “Real Blick”. This money is given to students as a form of recognition for activities recorded in class, behavior, homework, among others. With R eal Blick, students can make fictitious purchases of school materials, provided by the municipality's Department of Education. The project aims to instill in children's behavior care with personal and family finances.

The event took place in two locations: Jundiaí/SP and Capanema/PR, our host city. The solemnity aimed to strengthen the relationship and strengthen the partnership with the regional press, present the Sicredi system, as well as Sicredi Fronteiras and the actions implemented by the Cooperative, which directly impact communities. More than 70 media outlets participated in this edition of the meeting. Visit to the Agencies The president of the Co operative, José Cé sar Wünsch, together with the executive director, Fábio Júnior Câmera visited the agencies to speak to the teams about the guidelines of the Strategic Map, linked to competencies and the i Sicredi’s 2030 inspirational plan. 34Strategic Planning We have been carrying out short and long-term strategic planning independently for 30 years. Over the years, we have acquired experience and initiatives to ensure the monitoring and fulfillment of strategic objectives associated with the budget plan. This year, thinking about improving Strategic Planning, we sought out Litz Consulting, which, under the guidance of professor Mario Nei Paccagnan, brought methodologies literature and the opportunity to dare in a strategic challenge entitled “Mission 30”. Litz helped us strengthen a governance and integrated strategy management model, with the aim of guaranteeing the scope of the challenge and the results aimed at society. We use a methodology applied in Silicon Valley, where qualitative objectives measured by quantitative key results were basically defined. These objectives are all linked to the Strategic Map, built through the BSC – Balanced ScoreCard methodology, which translated the Co operative's mission and strategy into a comprehensive set of performance measures that serve as the basis for strategic management. We will carry out monitoring at the Tactical and Operational levels, as well as the action plans will become the basis for Strategic Analysis Meetings – RAE's, which will be specific and frequent, monitoring and aligning action with the strategy and the budget plan. Consolidation of the strategy is essential, since it is made up of several internal and external factors and components. Many of these factors are completely beyond the organization's control and prediction. Through them, Strategic Planning emerges as a tool capable of guiding management actions within a budget plan, improving the quality of decision-making and leveraging the Co-operative's vision of the future. 35 COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022Insurance without credit savings and insurance networks:Winners 2022 Check out the award-winning members 36We always look for solutions that meet the needs of financial planning and family protection, but above all, that bring benefits and differences to members.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our constitution we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social, and governance, in its acronym in English), seeks to demonstrate that the long-term survival of organizations depends on them also generating value in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the market’s “ESG vision”, understanding it as the management itself for the sustainability of the business. Si credi’s three essential strategic guidelines, which direct everything what we do:Mission, Vision and Values: describe the guidelines that guide our business and guide our development in practice. Based on our guidelines, we build the documents and systemic policies that guide our strategy, decision-making, operations and conduct. The Sustainability Policy establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact and reduce our adverse impact. For To guide our sustainable development strategy, we have established our sustainability drivers and focal themes. 40We have three directors divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicr edi's material themes, that is, the most relevant themes for Sicr edi's sustainability.

COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 47Launch of the Sustainability Committee In September, the Sustainability Committee was launched in our Cooperative, which is made up of 10 effective members and 10 substitutes, all employees from different areas. They will be the ones who will ensure a good flow of information on economic, financial, socio-environmental and governance aspects related to business, being an advisory mechanism for the Board of Directors. Sustainability at Sicredi is business management focused on expanding our positive impact in the economic, social, environmental and climate fields, reducing adverse impacts and generating value for associates, employees, communities and other interested parties. Members will seek, through the Cooperative's actions, to generate positive transformations in economic, social and environmental terms in the lives of associates and communities in which it operates, contributing to the construction of a more prosperous society. When it is said that ‘at Sicredi, money makes a better world’, this means that the system as a whole is truly concerned with people’s quality of life. We will continue to follow the Sustainability strategy, guided by three drivers: relationships and cooperativism, responsible solutions and local development. 48Strengthen our business model governance ASSEMBLY PROCESS Aims for member participation in the decision-making processes of their cooperative. With this program, we bring more transparency to our actions, establish the rules and guide the participatory management model, seeking member engagement. The member has contact with the program at meetings, nucleus assemblies, general assembly and other events promoted and organized by the cooperative, in addition to the daily relationship in the agency.The assembly process is characterized as an important moment for cooperativism because members participate directly in the decision-making process. In our Cooperative it is no different. This is the opportunity in which there is deliberation on the accountability of the Board of Directors for the previous year, on the allocation of results, election of core coordinators, election and remuneration of new board members and directors. scal, as well as statutory changes, among other points. This year, we broke the participation record. More than 16 thousand members from Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo were present at the assembly, which took place in digital format, in a transparent way and following the interest of the membership. Your participation results in better cooperation, because together with other members, you decide our next steps.

This is exactly how the distribution of results in a Credit Union works. This process is a of the great benefits and differences of becoming a business owner. We ended 2021 with the grandeur that a Cooperative of this size has. There were R$453 million in savings, R$1.8 billion in credit operations, R$1.6 billion in total resources, R$688 million in term deposits, R$280 million in net equity and we increased the table social network in more than 7 thousand members, celebrating a historic result of R$ 54.8 million, growth of 47% more than the year previous. This result guaranteed us the security that, at the time of the assembly, the beneficiaries themselves, that is, the members, could choose how the more than R$ 15.8 million would be distributed. We ended 2022 with the result of R$ 72.5 million, with R$332 million in equity, R$1.9 billion in founding resources and R$3.6 in managed resources. The way in which the results will be distributed will be decided in the 2023 Assembly Process. To ensure that the distribution is fair, participation in results occurs in proportion to the services and values ​​contracted and used. The logic is simple: whoever used the services more contributed more to obtaining this result. So, it makes sense for the associate to also have a greater share. INTEREST ON CAPITAL In addition to the distribution of results, the capital account also received on December 1, 2022, the payment of interest on own Capital of more than 5 million, with the associate therefore being doubly rewarded. 525252and the result is also yours.

Promote gender equity, empowerment and training of women so that they can increasingly assume new leading and leadership roles in Cooperatives and communities, that is our purpose!

With the theme “I, Woman – a call to leadership through action”, the event proposed that participants reflect on the legacy left by women who preceded them, as well as analyze the “true excuses” that make it difficult to achieve goals, generating paralysis and preventing transformation. We started the year with an online meeting involving everyone from the Women's Committee so that we could talk about planning, election of the coordinator and new projects. In June, women from Paraná and Santa Catarina met at the Administrative Headquarters of the Cooperative, while the city of Jundiaí received women members of the Committee who reside in the state of São Paulo. For this first in-person Women's Committee event since 2020, after the pandemic period, we brought Samar Merheb Jordão as a speaker. The main topics covered in the lecture were: “The construction of a good personal, social and professional image”, “Netiquette - and etiquette in the virtual world” and “Good manners in everyday life and in the work environment”. Still in June, Central PR/SP/RJ promoted an online meeting with the theme “We leaders”, with speaker Liliane Jacintho. Continuing the training path also at Central PR/SP/RJ, we participated in another event in Curitiba, this time with the motto “Woman, leader who transforms”. 54 Financial education is fundamental to the social and economic progress of a country. A financially educated population will not only know how to better manage their salaries and assets, but will also understand better about the economy and the market. With this in mind, we provided our women with training on financial education with Alyne Lemes, development advisor for Central Cooperatives. In view of this, the Women's Committee replicated this training, disseminating financial education workshops in the communities, impacting more than two thousand people. We ended the year with a great celebration. To celebrate all the learning and cooperation, we ended 2022 with an event in Capanema/PR and another in Jundiaí/SP, with the participation of actress Maria Paula Fidalgo, honoring us with speeches on the theme: “Being feminine”. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 55Two coordinators of the Youth Committee of our Cooperative participated in the Central PR/SP/RJ Summit, in April, with the theme “The future comes from the future.” We held an online meeting, still in April, to talk about planning for 2022 and electing new employees. We participated in the Central Summit, which brought together all members of the Cooperative Youth Committees to talk about reconnection with the past, purpose and cooperative legacy. In September we had a Financial Education training, carried out by André Alves Assis – Development Manager of Central Cooperativism PR/SP/RJ. After this training, our young people were in schools, associations and communities conducting Financial Education Workshops, which directly impacted more than two thousand people. To close the year, we met in person in Jundiaí/SP and in Capanema/PR. At this moment, we have the participation of Marcus Barão, who enchanted the young people by talking about leadership and protagonism. In addition to these actions by our Committee, we also count on the participation and engagement of young people in the Assembler Process, Cooperative Winter Campaign and D ia C. In July, we met in person in Jundiaí/SP and in Capanema/PR to discuss the purpose and development of projects, with the participation of professor Alan de Freitas. 56 Cooperatives in Action WRITING WITH SICREDI Created by our Cooperative in 2017, the Writing with Sicredi Program has become a reference in the regions in which we operate, with regard to education, training and information. Through this competition, children and teenagers in the 5th and 9th years of municipal and state schools in Ampére, Realeza and Planalto, in Pará, increase their vocabulary through reading and learn about Cooperatives and Financial Education, with the Comics of Turma da Mônica that we provide. 57 Guaraciaba/SCDIA DE COOPERAR We celebrate International Cooperative Day in an unprecedented way! This year, a movement that promoted volunteering benefited children from cities in which we are located. With the support of employees, committees and partners, we held an afternoon especially for children. At this time, there was face painting, inflatable toys, balloons and snacks. Atibaia/SP Capanema/PR COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 58Cooperativism in ActionCOOPERATIVE WINTER: The Cooperative Winter Campaign, held every year, aims to ensure that as many people as possible pass through, so worthy, for the coldest season of the year. For this to occur, the engagement of associates, employees and the community in general was necessary. In this way, we provide boxes at partner agencies and businesses to collect food, clothing, blankets and items.

We embrace the idea that financial education is one of the bases for generating a positive impact on society, and in light of this, we work intensively in the Cooperation Program at Ponta do Lápis. Composed of actions planned to meet the needs of young people, children and adults, the initiative seeks to bring financial education to the regions in which the cooperative financial institution operates, directly supporting members and local communities. The Program was created and is being implemented jointly between cooperatives, centers and the Sicredi Foundation, taking advantage of all the knowledge and xperience of the institution's professionals on the topic. Through its own methodology, the initiative provides support to guide the implementation of financial education actions throughout Sicredi's area of ​​activity. Financial Education activities were led by volunteers from 41 agencies in Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo and also members of the Women's Committee and the Young Committee. They went to schools, companies and associations, received students at agencies, among other activities, and used these moments to hold free workshops on planning, budgeting and financial education tips adapted to the reality of each audience. At the end of this action, we counted more than 2,000 people impacted. 62PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Solar Energy Credit Solar Energy Credit is a specific financing product for the acquisition of solar energy technology to assist members interested in using alternative sources and renewable sources of energy generation in its activities.

COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 63RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR AGRIBUSINESS In 2022, despite challenges such as, for example, the strong drought that hit our area of ​​operation in the municipalities of PR and S C, we had the greatest growth in history in the agro segment, both in value released and in number of members benefited for rural credit. We started the year with one of the biggest droughts in history, which resulted in the release of PROAGRO and Agricultural Insurance for more than 4,000 members who were covered with amounts exceeding R$ 150 million. Traditionally, in the month of July, we launch the 2022/2023 Harvest Plan through a live broadcast directly from the Capanema Administrative Headquarters. Still during this period, we provide a round of training for agro portfolio managers and technical assistance that provides drafting services. projects. In these meetings, the main changes to the new Harvest Plan and the Cooperative's strategy for this new cycle that began were discussed, holding events at branches in Paraná, Santa Catarina and S ão Pa ulo in person. Among the main factors that contributed to the growth of the credit portfolio in the agribusiness segment, we highlight the high demand for agricultural funding resources for the main grain crops in our area of ​​operation and agricultural investment lines, as is the example of Solidarity Tractor program in the state of PR, (The Solidarity Tractor, Implements and Equipment program for Family Farming in the state of Paraná makes it possible to finance tractors, sprayers and harvesters for small producers at more affordable prices. It is a partnership between the Department of Agriculture and Supply, IDR-Paraná, Fomento 64Promoting and developing agribusinessParaná, ﬁnancial agents and credit cooperatives, as well as manufacturers of implements, equipment, tractors and agricultural machines.). We were highlighted by the number of machines delivered (62 agricultural tractors and 12 grain harvesters) and the amounts financed exceeded R$ 15 million in this program alone. New technologies were implemented in the region's agribusiness, as is the example of the financing of spraying drones. Unmanned aircraft have been increasingly used to spray crops, providing speed and precision in agricultural operations. A single piece of equipment is capable of covering 12 hectares in one hour of work, production similar to d and a tractorized sprayer. In addition to water savings, there is also an improvement in spraying efficiency, up to 30% more than that of trailed tractors. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 65One of the lines of credit highly sought after by producers this year was for the acquisition of equipment and systems for generating photovoltaic energy, mainly due to the deadline for the protocol for tariff exemption for the surplus produced and directed to the electricity grid for projects approved by electricity concessionaires until December 2022. The main activities benefited in Sicredi Fronteiras' area of ​​activity were: poultry farming, dairy cattle farming, flower production and pig farming. In these cases, the producer replaces the electricity bill with the portion of the agricultural investment operation for the acquisition of the photovoltaic system, which is paid within a period of up to ten years, with monthly, semi-annual and annual installments. 66Credit for solar energy With the growing demand for renewable energy, credit for solar energy has become one of our main products linked to the green economy. Through this solution, members can obtain credit to purchase equipment and technology to capture solar energy and generate clean electrical energy in their homes, businesses and rural properties. Credit for enterprises led by women A line of credit aimed at micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. The initiative includes the gender factor as a criterion for the use of resources, as well as other social and environmental factors. Sustainable Finance Since 2021, we have structured the area of ​​Structured Operations and Sustainable Finance, with the with the aim of developing the topic within Sicr edi and intensifying the capture of resources for aligned credit to our values ​​and the Sustainability Strategy, through the issuance of bonds linked to social and environmental aspects. Financial letter In June 2022, S icredi launched the 1st sustainable financial note in the Brazilian market, raising R$780 million, with the resources being converted into credit for projects aligned with sustainability. The eligibility criteria selected for granting credit were: renewable energy, environmentally friendly management sustainable living natural resources and land use, green buildings, energy efficiency and clean transport. Investments In 2021, S icredi FIC Ações Sustentáveis ​​ESG was launched, Sicredi's first ESG-focused equity fund, aimed at companies aligned with the sustainability strategy and that generate a positive impact on society, in addition to profitability for members. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 67Sustainable Consortium Thinking about the socio-environmental impact of our products and services, we count on the Sustainable Consortium, focused on the acquisition and construction of container houses and investments in eco-efficient solutions, such as water and sewage treatment, energy efficiency and generation of wind and solar energy. Credit for family farming Credit for family farming is an important sustainability instrument, as it contributes to income generation and social development in communities. At the same time, the The segment is one of the main responsible for food production in Brazil and around the world, having the potential to implement sustainable management in production, with a view to reducing environmental impacts. 6869COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 69RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS Promote eco-efficient management We seek to make the operation of our agencies and headquarters more sustainable. Disseminate the implementation of good practices related to eco-efficiency and combating climate change icas. We neutralized 100% of greenhouse gas emissions from our inventory. SIS PLATFORM During this year, the agencies' sustainability agents completed the Cooperative's eco-efficiency reports through the SIS platform. The data will be analyzed and subsequently converted into sustainable actions, seeking to neutralize the environment. Commemorative dates are important because they represent the effort to stay alive in collective memory any event or tribute with a certain social relevance. Historical and cultural issues DID YOU KNOW? involve the days and fill some dates with meaning, making them relevant to communities. Some dates were celebrated in our Cooperatives, either with the delivery of a souvenir to the member or with the themed decoration of the branches on dates such as: Saint John's Day, Mother's Day, Women's Day, Easter, Father's Day, Yellow September, October pink, blue november, among others. At the institutional level, Compliance is responsible for implementing a set of guidelines to adapt our activities to legal, regulatory and political standards. Acting in Compliance means acting in accordance with our values ​​and standards, preserving ethical relationships and reducing risks. Promoting integrated risk management Taking risks is inevitable in the process of company evolution, but we need balance to understand how far it is safe to go and move towards the goals we want for our evolution. To deal with this, we present Integrated Risk Management: a set of strategies that aim to protect our institution from undesirable consequences that may occur when conducting business and our brand. Through 5 themes that work together - Brand, Risks, Compliance, Information Security and Internal Audit - we seek to predict situations and protect ourselves from impacts with in relation to the image and sustainability of our business.Complianc eIn what it gives to the brand, we seek to broaden the vision on how to care for and manage the exposure of our brand, reducing the risks of crisis situations in exposures or negative associations, based on pillars of our brand governance.Brand Risk themes exist to guarantee the sustainability of our institution, promoting a culture of mitigating financial and non-financial risks for servicing regulatory requirements, standardization of standards, methods, processes and tools.

This program that worked themes such as: purpose, feedback, non-violent communication and values, took place monthly, in an online format and ended in July. Program started in June 2022 with a duration of 5 months. This mentoring had the aim of bringing advisors closer to Sicredi Fronteiras culture and strategy. Bring them to awareness of the role and responsibility of the board in achieving Sicredi's objectives and strengthening Emotional and Organizational Intelligence. Hybrid Format (in-person and online). TRAINING ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We believe that our representatives, through training, can contribute even more to the development of the communities in which we operate, informing the general public, particularly young people and opinion leaders about the nature and advantages of cooperation. Therefore, we developed the Formation of the Administration, Fiscal and Board of Directors, which was mentored by Sandra Guerra, from Better Governance, a consultancy company specialized in corporate governance (CG), which offers support to improve the model and provide best governance practices in publicly traded, privately held companies or non-profit organizations. 77SEMINARIES We believe that seminars and lectures are important for the growth of our employees. These events motivate and help in the development and improvement of the quality of care, increasing the security and motivation, generating positive results throughout the organizational structure. This is because seminars shape employees and provide reasons to give their best in their roles. And more than that, it offers the team a safe, motivating, competitive, but at the same time collaborative and pleasurable environment. During 2022, we provided three seminars for the Sicredi Fronteiras team. 78The first seminar of the year took place in March, with speaker Ricardo Leite. He recalled the attitudes that characterize the ‘‘Sicredi Way of Being’’ in serving members and made several connections between the behavior of employees and the purpose of the Cooperative. In July, Pa ulo Storani, Coordinator of BOPE's 9th Special Operations Course, spoke with employees about the principles, concepts and methods that constitute an elite troop and high-performance teams. The closing seminar of the year was the moment to to celebrate the achievements of 2022 and glimpse the path that will be followed in 2023. The event was an immersion into M ission 30, the Strategic Planning theme that will be worked on throughout the C ooperative until 2026. NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SUMMIT The first edition of the National Summit Sicredi Governance Conference took place in July, with the participation of management and ﬁscal advisors from all Sicredi System entities. The aim of e vento was to reflect on issues relevant to our business model, such as governance, leadership and the role of credit unions in society. The fiscal and administration councilors of Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ took office during this meeting. Elected at the Ordinary General Assembly (AGO), with ratification of the acts carried out by the Central Bank of Brazil, the board members will continue to act until 2026. At this moment, the resident of our Cooperative, José César Wunsch, took possession of his mandate as board member. MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION CERTIFICATION Always seeking the appreciation and development of people, we started a training and certification program for Money Laundering Prevention and Terrorist Financing. This program initially focused on employees who work directly with the topic and who perform the functions of Financial Administrative Manager or Coordinator. Topics ranging from the influence of economic model in the specialization of criminal practices of an economic nature to international conventions on the prevention of money laundering. COOPERATIVA SICREDI FRONTEIRAS PR/SC/SP 2022 79 Employee satisfaction We were awarded fourth place as the best company to work in the “Financial Institutions - Credit Cooperatives” category by GP TW (Great Plac e to W ork). The ranking is published annually and rewards the best companies to work at national, regional, sectoral and thematic levels. In 2022, we reached a result (confidence index) of 89%. The survey included the participation of 29 thousand Sicredi employees, who contributed their perception of what it is like to work at the institution. In August 2022, S icredi was certiﬁed for the second consecutive year by the global consultancy Great Place to Work (GPTW – E xcelente Lugar Para Trabalho, in the English translation of the acronym). More than a title, This certiﬁcation is the result of a careful analysis, which demonstrates Sicredi’s focus on putting people at the center of decisions, which is valid not only for the more than six million members, but, before that, for the more than 37 thousand collaborators. Eye to eye relationships, the collaborative way of dealing with everyday situations, the search for development and the concern for sharing knowledge are details that value and synthesize the “Sicredi Jeito de To be". Only with the strength of the collective will we be able to transform our world. Therefore, at the same time that we develop financial solutions that support members, we seek to remain close and connected with the principles and values ​​of cooperativism, which is only possible in a company made up of happy and engaged people.
