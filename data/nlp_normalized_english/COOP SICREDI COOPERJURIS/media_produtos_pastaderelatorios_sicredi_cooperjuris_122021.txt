In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Justice System in the State of Ceará - Sicredi Cooperjuris (formerly known as Cooperativa de Economia and Mutual Credit of Magistrates, Members and Servants of the Judiciary, the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Public Defender's Office, the State Attorney General's Office, the Municipal Attorney General's Office, the Judiciary Police and Registration Officers in the State of Ceará - Sicredi Cooperjuris) on 31 December December 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operated by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion.2 Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the demos financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it has determined are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless that the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users made based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and we performed audit procedures in response to such risks, as well as obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  Obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to We plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is uncertainty relevant in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 ADMINISTRATION REPORT In this document, the administration of the Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative of the Justice System in the State doCeará -Sicredi Cooperjuris (formerly known as Economic and Mutual Credit Cooperative of Magistrates, Members and Servants of the Judiciary, the Public Ministry, the Public Defender's Office, the State Attorney General's Office, the Municipal Attorney General's Office, the Judiciary Police and Registration Officers in the State of Ceará -Sicredi Cooperjuris), following the principle pious of transparency cooperativism in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, discloses the Financial Statements relating to the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to the needs of each one in the resumption and maintenance of business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we return to operating in person at all branches, following the protocols of health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, our procedures underwent some adaptations to facilitate the granting of credit. We improved the offer of the solar energy generation incentive product and created a new product with a different rate to serve members who had no more resources or margin for endorsements. So we release credit with account guarantee. Some contracts also had installments extended. In addition, we opened a new agency, updated courses for our employees and reinforced the workforce with new hires. Everything to facilitate and speed up service. On another front, the cooperative promoted numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. An example was the action carried out within the scope of Cooperate Day (Day C) through which we donated food and personal hygiene items for a school we sponsor. We also encourage financial education courses for employees and associates through social media and live streams. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to combating the pandemic and economic recovery. Among the actions we highlight completely virtual service and, in the most exceptional cases, with the help of a drive and uber.ACTIVE 73,218 59.870                                          PASSIVO 61.626                                          48.808                                               DISPONIBILIDADES (Nota 04) 52                                                  180                                                   DEPÓSITOS (Nota 10) 47.103                                          36.645                                               INSTRUMENTOS FINANCEIROS 71.464                                          58.648 Demand deposits 3,139 2,106 Financial centralization (Note 04) 17,814 11,093 Interbank deposits 2,151 -

In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate.

The cooperative understands that the balance relating to the works or losses of the result does not operational is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted.

Regarding the results of any operations carried out with no cooperative members (non-cooperative act) are assessed and the taxes due are collected. The results of these operations are taken into account by the Technical, Educational and Social Assistance Fund - FATES, as provided for in Law No. 5,764/71. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ (15) (2020 - R$ (18)) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts.f) Non-financial assets held for sale Non-financial assets held for sale , determined by CMN Resolution No. 4,747/19, are segregated into own and received from third parties. These assets do not depreciate and are measured at fair value in accordance with the criteria established by CPC 46, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,748/19. •Own: represent assets owned by the cooperative which are not used in the performance of social activity, being available for immediate sale and whose disposal is highly probable within a maximum period of one year. • Received from third parties: represent goods received as a gift in payment of debts, not intended for personal use. g) Other current and long-term assets (non-current) The update of credit operations due within 59 days is accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled for a minimum of five years, in compensation accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. e) Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of operations, taking into account the economic situation, past experience, the specific and global risks of the portfolios, considering the provisioning criteria, defined in Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2. 697/00 of the CMN, associated with the assessments carried out by the Administration, in determination of credit risks.c) Inter-financial relations – financial centralization Financial centralization comprises the cooperative's cash surpluses not invested in its activities, which are centralized through inter-financial transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. d) Credit operations are demonstrated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to the Administration's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN. Cash and cash equivalents are represented by the availability, the values applied by Cooperatives in Centrals via Centralization Financial and fixed income and multimarket fund shares, whose operations maturity on the date of effective application is equal to or less than 90 days and present an insignificant risk of change in fair value. b) Cash and cash equivalents Interbank deposits are made up of resources received on deposit from other institutions in the market, in accordance with current regulations specific to interbank deposit operations, noting that the institution must maintain controls internal for the purpose of funding limits. Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions for the purpose of financing operations. m) Other current and long-term liabilities (non-current) Are stated at known or estimated values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro-rata basis per day incurred, deducted from corresponding expenses to be appropriated. Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its value recoverable amount, which is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use of an asset. l) Deposits, loan obligations and transfers They are stated at the amounts of liabilities, considering charges, monetary exchange variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro-rata basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability is immediate to members , therefore without a set deadline to move it, It is up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs. Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose. Term deposits are made up of amounts agreed for availability within pre-established deadlines, which receive updates for remunerative financial charges according to their post-fixed contract and are demonstrated at their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. Corresponds to rights that have as their object tangible assets intended for the maintenance of activities or exercised for this purpose. It is stated at the acquisition cost, deducted from the depreciation of fixed assets in use, which is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the annual rates mentioned in the Note "Fixed assets and intangible assets", which take into account the economic useful life of the assets. The useful life of assets and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each year in accordance with the criteria defined by CPC 27 - Fixed Assets, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,535/16. j) Intangible Intangible assets are identifiable intangible, non-monetary assets without physical substance, intended for the maintenance of the system or exercised for this purpose and generating benefits future economic assets acquired or developed by the institution. It is stated at cost values ​​and includes expenses for the acquisition and development of software, adjusted by accumulated amortizations, calculated from the moment in which the respective benefits begin to be enjoyed, based on annual rates that take into account the useful economic life of the assets, in accordance with the provisions of CMN Resolution nº 4,534/16 eCPC 04-Intangible Assets, as mentioned in the Note "Fixed assets for use and intangible assets". Accumulated amortizations, calculated from the moment the respective benefits begin to be enjoyed, at a rate of 10% to 20% per year, using the straight-line method. k) Reduction in the recoverable value of assets Stated at acquisition cost, including, when applicable, the income earned and the pro-rata currency variations incurred and exchange rate variations, deducted from the corresponding provisions for losses or adjustment to market value and income to be appropriated. h) Investments Stated at acquisition cost, they refer to participation in companies in the Sicredi System, adjusted by provision for losses when applicable. i) Fixed assets in usep) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every six months. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for losses expectations associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constitution of provision due to delay in payment of principal installments or charges of operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697 /00 from CMN. The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 05; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses evaluated by the Administration, constituting a provision for fiscal, civil, tax and labor demands through legal evaluations. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 13; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and others assets: the test for loss due to impairment of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects resulting from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: Management monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of the market and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the balance sheet lines that were affected.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not are provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success.n) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative events. The provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ is 15%, plus an additional 10% and the CSLL in which the rate went from 15% to 20% from July 2021 and will return to 15% from January 2022, applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation basis from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of the taxable profit.
