The resources receive updates for remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose.q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by the CPC Technical Pronouncement 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, passed in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. They are demonstrated by known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative matters. The provision corresponds to the current rates for the IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 15%. The IRPJ and CSLL rates are applied to the profit earned, after the calculation basis adjustments provided for in the legislation and the compensation of tax losses and negative CSLL calculation basis from previous years, with this deduction being limited to 30% of the taxable profit.

At the municipal level, the cooperative is subject to the incidence of the Tax on Services of Any Nature (ISSQN), calculated based on revenue from non-cooperative acts, that is, as a result of the provision of services to non-members; The rates vary between 2% and 5% and are determined by the legislation in force in each municipality.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constituting a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for civil, tax and labor claims, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account The probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element may involve a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained from external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; Total 14,287 21,436 Availability and liquidity financial investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of presenting the Cash Flow Statement, when complying with the provisions of CPC 03 (R2) – Cash Flow Statement.
