We did all this without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it further increased the prices of several commodities, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of Vaccination allowed the country to overcome the wave of the Ômicron variant, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and in the Federal District, completing its national expansion. The growth of the physical service network is aligned with the objectives of being close to meeting the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of associates and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, an increase of 15% compared to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new members.

NOTE 02 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The main accounting practices adopted to prepare the financial statements were: d) Interbank relations – financial centralization Financial centralization comprises the cooperative's cash balances not invested in its activities, which are centralized through interbank transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are applied to the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. Cash and cash equivalents are represented by cash and cash equivalents, by the values ​​invested by the Cooperatives in the Centrals via Financial Centralization and by the shares of fixed income and multimarket funds, whose operations maturity on the date of effective application is equal to or less than 90 days and present insignificant risk change in fair value. c) Interbank liquidity applications Represent fixed price operations referring to purchases of securities with a commitment to resell and applications in interbank deposits and are stated at redemption value, net of income to be appropriated corresponding to future periods.g) Non-financial assets held for sale Non-financial assets held for sale, determined by CMN Resolution No. 4,747/19, are segregated in-house and received from third parties. These assets do not depreciate and are measured at fair value in accordance with the criteria established by the CPC 46, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,748/19. •Own: represent assets owned by the cooperative which are not used in the performance of social activity, being available for immediate sale and whose disposal is highly probable within a maximum period of one year. • Received from third parties: represent goods received as a gift in payment of debts, not intended for personal use. h) Other current and long-term assets (non-current) Update credit operations due within 59 days are accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in unearned income. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in compensation accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet. f) Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk credit is based on the analysis of operations, taking into account the economic situation, past experience, the specific and global risks of the portfolios, considering the provisioning criteria, defined in Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN, associated with the assessments carried out by the Administration, in determining credit risks .e) Credit operations These are stated at cost plus income earned.

Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the the greater of the net selling price and value in use of an asset. m) Deposits, loan obligations and transfers They are stated at the amounts of liabilities, considering charges, exchange variations and monetary variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro-rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of amounts whose availability is immediate to associated parties, therefore without a specific deadline to move it, at the discretion of the holder do it according to your needs. Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the holder of the resources to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose.

The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements that reflect the risk appetite of the system, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and guarantee business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy to management and council administration; II - Operational Risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for third-party damages arising from activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal regulations containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's staff; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on culture of risks and controls in the Institution; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to evaluate, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution.NOTE 23 – RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Sicredi System considers risk management to be a priority in the conduct of its business activities, adopting practices in absolute accordance with the precepts of the Basel Accords.
