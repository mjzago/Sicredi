Francisco Antonio Tavora Colares President CPF: 016.836.815-33 Letter of Introduction Credit, Savings and Cooperative Investment in the Justice System in the State of Ceara - Sicredi Cooperjuris Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Confederation Sicredi Accounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendence of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 Independent auditor's report on the financial statements To the Administrators, Advisors and Cooperative Members Credit, Savings and Investment in the Justice System in the State of Ceara - Sicredi Cooperjuris Fortaleza - CE Opinion We examined the financial statements of Cooperativa D e Credito, Poupança E Investimento Do Sistema de Justiça No Estado do Ceara - Sicredi Cooperjuris (“Cooperative”) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and the respective effective statements of surpluses or losses, comprehensive income, changes in net equity and cash flows for the year ending on that date, as well as the corresponding notes explanatory documents, including a summary of the main accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as at December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ended. on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Bank Central do Brasil (BA CEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the standards professionals issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be distorted in a relevant way. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the board and governance for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BA CEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our The objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions can be arising from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:  We identify and evaluate the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity . If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include modification in our opinion, if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events manner compatible with the objective of adequate presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.

We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our associated with and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates They are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw a increased inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March of this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 at range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of reduction of global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the cycle of rising interest rates with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. It is it should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the The entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about fiscal policy which will be carried out in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: * Seeking to promote the values ​​of cooperation, Sicredi Cooperjuris developed a playful and interactive dynamic, in a ring game format, such as way of presenting solutions and promoting the practice of cooperativism. The model was worked on in three June festivals of associated institutions (legal entities) and partners – SINDJUSTIÇA, ASSEMPECE and ACM, which bring together associates, civil servants and members of the Justice System. The activities were carried out on June 25th and July 2nd and 8th, 2022 and included our associates and prospects, with 168 direct participations. * As a C-Day initiative, Sicredi Cooperjuris promoted the presentation of the musical show <AFloresta Econômica - A Financial Adventure=, for students at the Judiciary Day Care Center. The action was carried out on October 10th, in the auditorium of the Escola Superior da Magistratura do Estado do Ceará (Esmec). In a playful and humorous way, in its plot, the play promotes financial education and conscious consumption in childhood, through the culture of cooperativism. The presentation was part of the Children's Week program at Judiciary Daycare Center, the event brought together more than 130 children, as well as parents, family members and former students of the daycare center, which serves children and grandchildren of employees and members of the Court of Justice of the State of Ceará. At the end of the event, exclusive comic books from Turma da Mônica on financial education prepared by Sicredi were distributed to each child. C Day is much more than a day full of solidarity. This is one of the initiatives that materialize our commitment to the Pact Global and that enables people to engage through the exchange of knowledge and experiences. * Sicredi Cooperjuris immortalized the essence of cooperation and our brand in the memory of associates and prospects who participated in the PUBLIC SERVANT DAY PARTY – SINDJUSTIÇA, the SINDOJUS CONFRATERNIZATION - 30 YEARS, the SINDJUSTIÇA CONFRATERNIZATION, the ASSEMPECE CONFRATERNIZATION, the ACMP CONFRATERNIZATION , the ACM CONFRATERNIZATION and the SINTRAJUFE CONFRATERNIZATION. The events took place on the days October 27th, December 9th, 16th, 17th and 20th respectively. On these occasions, the cooperative provided a 360º rotating platform for recording instant videos and a photo booth for printing photos on the spot. Both mention the cooperation and votes of Sicredi Cooperjuris.

Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society. Board of Directors and Board* As an initiative of the 9th National Financial Education Week, on December 15th, we promoted an activity with the presentation of the musical show <A Floresta Econômica - A Financial Adventure=, at the School of Education Children and Elementary Education Monsenhor André Viana Camurça, which is located in Caucaia-CE.

At the event, our cooperative donated, through a draw, basic food baskets to mothers of students.
