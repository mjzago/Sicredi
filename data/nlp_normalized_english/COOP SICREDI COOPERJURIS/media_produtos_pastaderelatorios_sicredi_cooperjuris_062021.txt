The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 05; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by the Administration, constituting a provision for demands of a fiscal, civil, tax and labor nature through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may involve a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 13; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indicative that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects resulting from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: The Administration monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes the monitoring of capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of the market and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. q) Functional currency The financial statements are presented in the functional currency which is the real (R$), and the information, unless otherwise indicated, in thousands of reais (R$ thousand). •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, finalized in court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. p) Main judgments and accounting estimates When preparing the Financial Statement, applications of certain assumptions and relevant judgments are required, which involve a high degree of uncertainty and which may produce relevant impact on these statements. Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. The estimates and judgments considered most relevant by Management are detailed below:o) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities and also legal obligations are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: Obligations for loans with resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., operate with a rate of CDI + 0.85% maturing on 10/15/2026.
