Sicredi, as a cooperative financial institution, is committed to the growth of its members and the development of the regions where it operates. We remain firm in our commitment to contributing to the economic activity of communities, considering their different realities and needs, constantly seeking to create opportunities for connection between associates and the latest technological trends, stimulating income generation and local economic and social development, with the purpose of having a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable society every day.

We did it all without forgetting to look at the socio-environmental impact of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it raised prices even further. of various commodities, since both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to overcome the wave of the variant Ômicron, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion.

Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of associates and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new cooperators. With roots in the countryside, and a long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 2nd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents:r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment , which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these Estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constitution of provision in function delay in payment of the principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions no. 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN.

The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 15; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as payable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) are levied on the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ is 15%, plus an additional 10% and the CSLL in which the rate went from 15% to 20% from July 2021 and will return to 15% from January 2022, applied to the profit earned, after base adjustments decalculation provided for in legislation and compensation of tax losses and negative calculation basis of CSLL from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of taxable profit.

CPR operations are carried out with associates since which are guaranteed by the cooperative via a letter of guarantee instrument, the joint guarantee and the nature of the Sicredi cooperative system are considered to define a single spread for all counterparties. Fund shares are valued daily, through the value of the share, published by the fund administrator on the CVM and ANBIMA website.

As provided in Art. 5th of BACEN Resolution No. 4,800/20, provision in the face of loss for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must focus only on the amount equivalent to the Equity allocated for this purpose, these amounts are being presented together with the amount provisioned for credit operations and other credits. The Cooperative also has Co-obligations in guarantees provided in the amount of R$92,909 (December 2021 - R$87,980) which include operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to members via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor by virtue of a contract signed between the parties (Note 24). The provisions arising from these contracts comprise the amount of R$ 1,245 (December 2021 - R$ 1,027) as per Note 14.
