South Riograndense Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative - Sicredi União Metropolitana RS Source: Accounting and Fiscal Management - Sicredi ConfederationAccounting and Fiscal ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendence of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 #Classification of information: Internal UseWe have expanded our service capacity, reaching the number of 24 branches in the 9 municipalities of the cooperative, with the opening of the Moinhos de Vento Agency in Porto Alegre/RS. There were also significant improvements to the physical facilities of Agencies Cachoeirinha, Esteio and Gravataí Centro. The new agencies are even more modern and offer comfort and convenience to associates and employees. The new facilities have meeting and training rooms for members to use, by appointment. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more of 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our associates are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in results and decisions of cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperation, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fedfunds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% -4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023 . The effect of rising interest rates in advanced economies contributed to repricing measures of risk by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the high interest rate cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should continue at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advance of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the escalation of prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. In this context, under the name of Central das Caixas Rurais, it was founded by the Caixas congress, held in Santa Maria on September 6, 1925, with headquarters in Porto Alegre, today Sicredi União Metropolitana RS. Our cooperative's mission is to value RELATIONSHIPS, offer financial solutions to ADD TO INCOME and contribute to IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE of members and society. #Classification of information: Internal UseWe value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation.

These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or loaned to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations These are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to the Administration's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, to debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The update of credit operations due within 59 days is accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level “H” remain in this classification for six months, when they are then written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in compensation accounts, no longer appearing in the balance sheet.c) Interbank liquidity applications These represent fixed price operations referring to the purchase of securities with a commitment to resell and investments in interbank deposits and are stated at the redemption value, net of the income to be appropriated corresponding to future periods. d) Securities The portfolio is made up of fixed income securities, variable income securities and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to the respective market values, as applicable. Income and expenditure, as well as income and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the accrual regime, which establishes that income and expenditure, income and expenses must be included in the calculation of results for the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated , regardless of receipt or payment, allocated proportionally according to the amounts of gross income from a cooperative act and gross revenue from a non-cooperative act, when not identified with each activity. The result is determined in accordance with the accrual regime, which establishes that revenues and expenses must be included in the calculation of results for the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated, regardless of receipt or payment. Operations with fixed rates are recorded at redemption value, and revenues and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents: Description 12/31/2022 12/31/2021Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in values divergent due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of their determination. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constituting a provision due to delays in the payment of a principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for tax, civil, tax and labor demands through legal assessments. The evaluation of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of disbursements by the entity for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the existing uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the loss test due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring the associated potential future economic benefits; IV-Measurement of the effects arising from Covid-19 in the Financial Statements and impacts on the Cooperative: The Administration monitors the evolution of its operations, which includes monitoring capital and liquidity levels, the behavior of the credit risk of assets, the risks of the market and its financial instruments, the production of new credit operations and the evolution of funding. The main effects and impacts resulting from Covid-19 on the Financial Statements for this period are described, when applicable, in the notes corresponding to the Balance Sheet lines that were affected. s) Functional currencyr) Main accounting judgments and estimates #Classification of information: Internal UseDescription Minimum 31/12/21 Adicional  31/12/21 AA - 0,00                          -                 -   A 0,50 0,00                 3.034                 -   B 1,00 0,00                 2.301                 -   C 3,00 0,00                 2.121                 -  D 10,00 0,00                 2.807                 -   E 30,00 0,00                 3.533                 -   F 50,00 0,00                 2.247                 -  G 70,00 5,00                 5.686                 -  H 100,00 0,00               17.997 - Total 39,726 - As of 2022, the Cooperative adopted provision percentages higher than the minimums defined in CMN Resolution No. 2,682/99, taking into account, in addition to legal criteria, the economic situation, projections and uncertainty scenarios for the period, the experience of operating in the region and the knowledge it has about its member base, on January 21, 2022, after analyzing the scenarios by the cooperative's committees (Executive Board and Council of Administration), the strategy of increasing the percentage of provision reaching “G” was adopted, from the current 70.00% to 75.00% from February 1, 2022, as a way of protecting the cooperative for future and possible increases in default.

Below we present the operations carried out with administrators: Nature of the operation 12/31/2022 % in relation to the total 12/31/2021 #Classification of information: Internal UseTotal Total The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: • Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above the minimum legal requirements and that reflect the risk appetite of the system, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and guarantee business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner;• Capital Plan for each Institution of the System, consistent with the strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years;• Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors; II - Operational Risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated to inadequacy or deficiencies in contracts signed by the institution, to sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and to compensation for third-party damages resulting from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the entire institution; • Identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation of operational risks; •Identification, collection and treatment of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Dissemination of the risk management culture throughout the organization; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses arising from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to evaluate, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular operation of the institution.
