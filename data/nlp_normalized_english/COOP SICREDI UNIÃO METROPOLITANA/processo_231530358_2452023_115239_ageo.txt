PortoAlegre/RS, March 3, 2023. ImanjaraAlexsandraMarquesdePaula -Director-President-COOTRAVIPA ⁄ INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Russia and China duel with the US and allies at G-20 meeting The disagreement between the western bloc led by the United States and the alliance between Russia and China dominated the discussions between the foreign ministers of the G-20, a group of the most developed economies on the planet, and halted the preparation of a joint statement on the War in Ukraine. The new clash, while Brazil tests its intention to be a mediator in the conflict, took place at the ministerial summit in New Delhi - where the hosts, eager for abundant and cheap oil from Russia, are also seeking the neutral position de- split by Itamaraty. Like on the weekend, when the Finance Ministers of the G-20 met in another Indian city, Bangalore, there was no agreement on the terms of a declaration. The Chinese and their Russian allies vetoed the idea of ​​a direct condemnation of the invasion that completed one year last Friday. The uneasiness was defined in the first meeting after the war between the heads of Russian and North American diplomacy, Serguei Lavrov and Antony Blinken, before the event's plenary meeting. Both had crossed paths at a similar meeting in Bali in July past, but they did not dialogue. They spoke quickly for ten minutes, and agreed to disagree. “We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and exit Ukraine, in the name of international peace and economic stability. Unfortunately, this meeting was once again marred by unjustified and unprovoked war,” Blinken said in a statement. According to the State Department, he asked Russia to reconsider returning to the last treaty limiting nuclear weapons, New Start, in which Vladimir Putin suspended his country's participation last week. And he insisted on Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry was even more economical, saying that Lavrov and Blinken spoke “in passing” and that nothing substantial was discussed. According to Russia, the G-20 agenda was turned into “a farce” by the West, as countries like the USA and allies sought to blame the Kremlin for the world's economic problems.
