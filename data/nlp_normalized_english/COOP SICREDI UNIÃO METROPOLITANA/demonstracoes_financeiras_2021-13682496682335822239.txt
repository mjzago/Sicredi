South Riograndense Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative - Sicredi União Metropolitana RS Source: Accounting and Fiscal Management - Sicredi ConfederationAccounting and Fiscal ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Accounting and Fiscal SuperintendenceFinancial Statements 2021 #Classification of information: Internal UseBoard of Directors and Board of DirectorsThe year 2021 was marked by the resumption . Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi maintained the virtuous cycle of living cooperativism. Through the credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, We closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which has made it possible to expand the range of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. Also We have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: we expanded our service capacity, reaching the mark of 23 branches in 9 municipalities where the cooperative operates, with the opening of a new branch located in the Niterói neighborhood in Canoas/RS. There were also significant improvements in the physical facilities of the Sapucaia do Sul (located in the city of Sapucaia do Sul/RS), Hípica and Alberto Bins (located in Porto Alegre/RS) branches. The new spaces are even more modern and offer comfort and convenience to members. With the repositioning of the Alberto Bins agency, it was renamed the Indepêndencia agency. Furthermore, We highlight the growth in the number of members and the increase in the collection of managed resources. The cooperative also worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: •Social Development Fund: support for projects that develop culture, education, sport, health, safety and sustainability in all municipalities where it operates; •AUnião FazaVida Program: we develop training pedagogical activities for teachers, aiming to promote the principles of cooperation and citizenship in children and adolescents through cooperative projects; •School Cooperatives Program: through this program, we expand learning opportunities for children and adolescents, undertaking and experiencing the values ​​and principles of cooperativism; •Ponta doLápis Cooperation Program: we promote the training of employees, to act as multipliers, stimulating awareness about the importance of education and financial planning in the locations where we are present; •Women Committee Program: we hold lectures to support the personal and professional development, growth and strengthening of women members participating in the Committee. Traditionally, Sicredi actively participates in Cooperation Day (C Day), celebrated on July 3rd. This year, we developed the “Cooperative Truck” action aimed at collecting food, collecting more than 25 tons. To the Donations were allocated to entities that directly benefited people experiencing food insecurity. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to tackling the pandemic and economic recovery. And we continue to operate the “People Who Cooperate Care” and “I Cooperate with the Local Economy” movements, which helped us take care of people and communities. Together and through cooperation, we are building a more prosperous and human society. We thank our associates for the partnership in 2021, and that in 2022 we can continue together, cooperating for the development of our region.

4,642 4,642 The reclassified values ​​are shown in the tables below: STATEMENTS OF SURPLUS AND LOSSESPreviously PresentedReclassification Represented 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council -CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil -BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20 that regulated procedures for the preparation and disclosure of financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives were also observed, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, this was carried out reclassification of tickets intercooperative deposits, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centers via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other income and operating income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the values ​​captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operational result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which the statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses of non-operational income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, related reclassifications were identified the change in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant value risk, making it possible to classify them as cash and cash equivalents in accordance with the assumptions doCPC 03. The aforementioned correction affected the initial and final cash equivalent of the period ending on December 31, 2020, as well as the movement of titles and securities where they were previously presented. The execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. o) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts.
