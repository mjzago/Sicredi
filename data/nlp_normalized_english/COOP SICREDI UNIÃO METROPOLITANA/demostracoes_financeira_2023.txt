Operations with fixed rates are recorded at redemption value, and income and expenses corresponding to the future period are presented in a reducing account of the respective assets and liabilities. Income and expenses of a financial nature are accounted for on a pro-rata basis and calculated based on the exponential model, except those relating to discounted securities or related to foreign operations, which are calculated based on the linear method. Operations with fees post-fixed or indexed to foreign currencies are updated up to the balance sheet date.

The update of credit operations due within 59 days is accounted for in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day onwards, in income to be appropriated.

These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or loaned to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations Term deposits are made up of values ​​agreed for availability within pre-established deadlines, which are updated by remunerative financial charges according to their post-fixed contract and are demonstrated by their redemption value, net of ongoing financial expenses. Interbank deposits are made up of resources received on deposit from other institutions in the market, in accordance with current regulations specific to interbank deposit operations, noting that the institution must maintain internal controls for the purpose of funding limits. Obligations for loans and transfers correspond to resources transferred by Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, Cooperativa Central and other institutions with the purpose of financing operations.m) Reduction in the recoverable value of assets Fixed assets and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed annually to identify evidence of non-recoverable losses, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this is the case, the recoverable amount is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount in which the value The asset's accounting value exceeds its recoverable value, which is the higher of the net selling price and the value in use of an asset. n) Deposits, loan obligations and onlendings They are demonstrated by the amounts of liabilities, considering the charges, monetary exchange variations up to the date of the financial statements, recognized on a pro rata-die basis, segregated as follows: Demand deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability is immediate to associated partners, therefore without term determined to move them, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs. Savings deposits are made up of values ​​whose availability can be freely moved, leaving it up to the resource holder to do so according to their needs, and also for specific purposes. Resources receive updates through remunerative financial charges in accordance with their purpose.k) Fixed assets for use Corresponds to rights that have tangible assets as their object intended for the maintenance of activities or carried out for this purpose.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constituting a provision due to delays in payment of a principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on judgment of the Administration regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions nº 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II-Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by the Administration, constituting provision for civil, tax and labor demands, through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment, the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in the note Provision for civil, tax and labor risks; III-Reduction to the recoverable value of intangible assets and others assets: the loss test due to impairment of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, mainly in measuring the associated potential future economic benefits;q) Provision for civil, tax and labor Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are only recognized when there are real guarantees or favorable judicial decisions, passed in court. Successful contingent assets probable are only disclosed in an explanatory note; • Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success.
