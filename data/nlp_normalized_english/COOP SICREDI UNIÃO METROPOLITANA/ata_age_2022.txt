He clarified that the aforementioned correction is necessary considering that the Cooperative was founded on September 6, 1925, called the Central Cooperative of Rural Caixas “Raiffeisen Type” of the Popular Union of the State of Rio Grande do Sul and that on August 19, 1967 there was a reorganization of the corporate structure, transforming the Central Cooperative into a Singular Cooperative, called Cooperativa de Crédito Sulriograndense L TDA, according to records in official documents filed at the Cooperative Headquarters.

Subsequently, it proposed the amendment of Article 12, § 2 and § 11, with a change in capital minimum share capital to join and remain active at Cooper, as well as improvement in the wording in relation to the refund of share capital to the terminated member, respectively. Afterwards, he presented the proposal to amend Article 27, IX to change the requirement for occupying a position on the Board of Directors. Finally, he proposed changing Article 33, V to improve the wording in relation to the requirements for occupying a position on the Executive Board. In effect, the aforementioned provisions will have the following wording: “Art. 1st The South Riograndense Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative – Sicredi União Metropolitana RS, established at the general assembly of September 6, 1925, is a financial institution, cooperative society, non-profit and with limited liability, governed by legislation v current and by these Bylaws, having: (...)

(...) § 11. The Share Capital, at the discretion of the Administration Council, may be returned to the terminated member, before the general meeting referred to in § 9 of this article takes place, provided that: (...) Art. 27. (...) (...) IX- have worked assiduously and regularly with the Cooperative in the last 2 (two) financial years (being an active member) and have regularly participated in core assemblies. (...) Art. 33 . (...) (...) V – meet the complementary systemic requirements when provided for in the regulations.” Then, Mr. Alcides Brugnera passed the floor to the President of the Cooperative, Mr. Ronaldo Netto Sielichow, to put the matter to a vote.
