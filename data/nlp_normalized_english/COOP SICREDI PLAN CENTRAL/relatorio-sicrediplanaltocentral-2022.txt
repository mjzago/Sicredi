In 2022, Sicr edi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperatives, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model has been In 2022, we complete 120 years of history. A journey that is closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. In this collective path, the central objective is to show that the best choices are those that generate results for everyone.

Trajectory Sicredi becomes a Member of the UN Global Compact.Sicredi celebrates 120 years of history in credit cooperativism.Cooperativism: 120 years 05 Planalto Central Sicredi 06The principles of cooperativism are the guidelines through which cooperatives take put their values ​​into practice. Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people able to use their services and assume responsibilities as members, without gender, social, racial, political and religious discrimination. All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as the election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where financial institutions traditional companies do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each product or financial service that members hire from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region. Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its associates. Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a democratic management model. Cooperatives promote the education and training of their members, elected representatives and workers, so that they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public, particularly young people and opinion leaders, about the nature and advantages of cooperation.

The objective of the first cooperative was to improve living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our pr emises since our founding. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reﬂect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Management Report In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Bank Central ended the cycle of rising interest rates with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should continue at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good growth of GDP in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more severe. evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2%. % in the October reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in credit and the escalation of prices echoes. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new elected president and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. In the year 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and the world, after the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. As a response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the cycle of rising global interest rates. The highlight It was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) that began its interest rate hike cycle in March of this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of increasing interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth.
