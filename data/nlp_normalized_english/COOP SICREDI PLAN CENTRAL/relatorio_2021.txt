In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on said financial statements.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud can involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation. ∙ We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. ∙ We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. ∙ We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in in relation to the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention to our audit report for the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.
