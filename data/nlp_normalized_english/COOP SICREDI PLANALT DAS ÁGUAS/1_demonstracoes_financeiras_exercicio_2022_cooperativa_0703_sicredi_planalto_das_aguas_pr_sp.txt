In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for preparing and adequately presenting the financial statements in accordance with industry practices accounting standards adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, the matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for audit of financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects possible distortions existing relevant data. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from an error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing the internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation.

Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.

We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, Resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, with the founding of the first cooperative credit, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its cycle of interest rate hike in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023 The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in world growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a trend disinflationary. In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity has already been showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy are taking hold. become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. If, on the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society We opened four new agencies: Nhandeara SP, Palmeira D´Oeste SP, Estrela D´Oeste SP and Goioxim PR, in addition to the Regional Noroeste Paulista, with a structure of professionals to support the eight agencies in the area of ​​responsibility in the state of São Paulo. With this expansion, the cooperative reached twenty branches. We had expansions and revitalizations in other branches due to the restructuring of portfolios, foreseen in the RAAS Project (Active Relationship with Associates), which enabled the increase of more than 30% of new employees in the cooperative, going from 254 (December 2021) to 333 in December 2022. Also noteworthy are the supervision indicators, in which the cooperative secured a maximum score of 100 points, demonstrating the seriousness and business sustainability, according to established criteria.

We developed the COONECTA Program, which brought content about cooperativism, sustainability, financial education and innovation to students from rural schools in the municipality of Pinhão in Paraná, in which students identified local difficulties and suggested solutions in accordance with the themes presented. During ENEF Week (National Financial Education Strategy) promoted by the Central Bank of Brazil, We carried out 29 actions through the cooperative, taking the topic to children, young people and also companies, totaling more than two thousand people impacted by the topic of Financial Education.
