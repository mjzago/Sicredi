In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Terra dos Pinheirais of Paraná and Noroeste Paulista - Sicredi Planalto das Águas PR/SP on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out,2 we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the board and governance by financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements unless the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid ceasing operations. Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those with responsibility for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the The audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian standards and international audit firms, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We assess the adequacy of policies accounting estimates used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.3  We concluded on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should call attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9 MANAGEMENT REPORT In this document, the administration of the Cooperative of Credit, Savings and Investment Terra dos Pinheirais do Paraná and Noroeste Paulista -Sicredi Planalto das Águas PR/SP, following the cooperative principle of transparency in management and in compliance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the related Financial Statements to the year ended December 31, 2021, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing ocommitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining businesses. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we return to operating deform in person at all branches, following the protocols of health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of resumption, we highlight the following administrative facts: - For the first time in history, the Assemblies and Accountability events, which guarantee the transparency of information with Associates, were held in the online format and had great participation by part of the associates, who deliberated in favor of the future of the cooperative; - As a way to encourage the use of renewable energy, we held Environment Week, providing information on how it is advantageous to invest in photovoltaic panels. In 2021, more than R$11 million was released for members to purchase and install equipment to capture solar energy; - We had a 67% growth in the credit portfolio compared to the same period in 2020. The highlight was the release of more than R$19 million to companies of women entrepreneurs; - We plan to expand coverage in our area of ​​operation. For 2022, the forecast is to open five more branches, one in Paraná and four in São Paulo. On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: - We expanded our hive with the operation of the “A União Faz a Vida” program in seven more municipalities in the area of ​​operation; - We developed actions that highlighted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in accordance with the UN 2030 agenda, in particular World SDG Week, in which we had a partnership with the Smurfs to disseminate the theme; - We held Enef Week (National Financial Education Strategy) through 40 workshops with the Cooperative's stakeholders. We delivered 20 thousand copies of "Turma da Mônica Jovem" comic books to high schools and another 15 thousand copies to the public of municipal schools; - On Cooperate Day (Day C), the actions were aimed at collecting food and hygiene materials to help people in social vulnerability during the pandemic; - Under the leadership of the Women's Committee, we developed local actions to collect sanitary pads that were donated to entities that serve teenagers, young people and women in difficulty. In some cities, the initiative became municipal law, providing for the donation of sanitary pads on a permanent basis; - A From the Crescer Program, we promote moments to provide relevant information to members about the importance of Credit Cooperatives. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that members' demands were met, especially those related to combating the pandemic and economic recovery. With the aim of providing a safer environment for employees and associates, we made a series of adaptations and posted communications with guidance on agencies. We also encourage the use of digital channels and remain close to our associates to ensure that daily demands are met, minimizing the impact caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Sicredi Planalto das Águas PR/SP ("Cooperative"), is a cooperative financial institution, affiliated to the Central Cooperative of Credit, Savings and Investment of the States of Paraná, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -Central Sicredi PR/SP/RJ (“Central”) and member of the Sicredi Cooperative System (“Sicredi”). The Cooperative is a non-banking financial institution, authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil ("Bacen") with beginning of activities on 08/10/1983 and headquarters located at R. das Flores, 506, in the city of Guarapuava - Paraná. The Cooperative's main objectives are: i) Develop savings programs, appropriate use of credit and provision of services, carrying out all active, passive and ancillary operations typical of credit cooperatives; ii) Provide, through mutuality, financial assistance to members in their specific activities; iii) Work on the educational training of its members, with a view to promoting cooperativism. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN THOUSANDS OF REAIS) The reclassified values ​​are shown in the tables below: STATEMENTS OF SURPLUS AND LOSSESPreviously PresentedReclassification Represented 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council -CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil -BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20 that regulated procedures for the preparation and disclosure of financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives were also observed, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, reclassification was carried out of tickets intercooperative deposits, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses of non-operational income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the groups of accounts of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. The execution of the activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and to Sicredi’s internal rules. As of December 31, 2021, Sicredi is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network of 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates in 16 service points. The structure also has five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Sicredi Cooperatives (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”). The Cooperative is an integral part of the Guarantee Fund doCredit Cooperativism (FGCoop), a non-profit civil association, with legal personality under private law with national coverage, as per Annex I to the resolution of the National Monetary Council ("CMN") No. 4,284, of November 5, 2013. OFGCoop's purpose is to provide credit guarantees in cases of intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance and financial support operations and liquidity with these institutions.
