And in 2022 it was no different, where we once again reached the end of the year aligned with the demands for a fairer and more sustainable society, placing credit cooperatives as an alternative within of the national financial system. With more than 140 thousand members, 61 branches, total assets above R$5.6 billion, we demonstrate the magnitude of the cooperative and its ability to overcome the challenges that arise each year. 2022 was a year of recovery, post pandemic, where we sought together to do our best so that we could celebrate great achievements at the end of this year, always with the concern to maintain the essence of being cooperative, as only then can we fulfill our commitments. our purpose of building a more prosperous society together. The financial return to our members was very significant, where we credited the highest value ever in interest to capital and once again we will have another great result that will be shared with our membership. We contribute to the local economy through exemption from relationship basket fees and exemption from annual credit card fees for our individual members, ensuring that resources circulate in our communities. For us, financial inclusion is transformation. Transforming the lives of people, companies and society is what makes a difference in our daily lives. Promoting and adding to the development of our society, generating wealth for everyone. 5 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 2022The trust and credibility of our members made our assets reach close to R$600 million, creating the necessary conditions for us to be able to grow and carry out our expansion process, with the opening of five more agencies on Minas Gerais soil. In the social area, we support projects that made a difference in communities, where more than R$1.4 million were invested in health, social well-being, education, the environment, improvements in structures and protection for our associates. Through our education fronts, we trained hundreds of associates, disseminating cooperative culture, financial education and leadership, with the Crescer, Pertencer and Cooperação programs in Ponta do Lápis. In our Group meetings and assemblies show the work carried out by our cooperative in the regions where we operate, with great proximity and transparency. With the A União Faz a Vida and School Cooperatives Programs, we promote cooperation and citizenship through the comprehensive education of more than 6,000 children and adolescents in more than 50 schools in the municipalities in our area of ​​operation. 2022 was also a year of celebration, for the more than 100 cooperatives that make up the Sicredi System. There are 120 years of implementation of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, Sicredi Pioneira. And through the words of Father Theodor Amstad, patron of cooperativism in Brazil, we want, in some way, to honor the associates who were with us, entrusting their resources, seeking financial solutions that helped them grow and develop in their activities: “For if a large stone crosses the path and 20 people want to pass, they won't be able to if they look for it one by one remove individually. But if 20 people come together and push at the same time, under the guidance of one of them, they will be able to jointly move the stone away and open the way for everyone.” And believing in this sentence given by Father Theodor Amstad, we follow our commitment in 2023, to do serious and sustainable work, both in our digital media and in our physical agencies, together with our more than 650 center coordinators, more than 700 employees, directors and Advices. The search for excellence is a constant motivation for evolution in all areas of our cooperative. On the following pages, we will show some of the work carried out in 2022 and with this we want to demonstrate to all our associates how important Sicredi UniEstados is for the development of the municipalities where we are present. The word gratitude is certainly the one that best defines our feeling in 2022. We thank you, on behalf of the Board of Directors, for all your support and trust placed in the cooperative and we count on all of you again in 2023, so that together we can increasingly develop our regions, whether in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina or Minas Gerais. Thank you, a big hug to everyone.

A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. Moluptam fugitet qui quunt.Occus, aut exerum non nihicimagnis.Velecaepudis quamet facimollores. Father Theodor Amstad9 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 2022For if a large stone crosses the path and 20 people want to pass, they will not be able to if one by one they try to remove it individually. But if the 20 come together and push at the same Over time, under the guidance of one of them, they will be able to jointly move away the stone and open the way for everyone.” Theodor AmstadTheodor Amstad was born in Switzerland in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put into practice this collective vision for building a future better. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcame the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining through time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promotion of quality of life. 10 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISMTimeline Discover some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petrópolis/RS, currently Sicredi Pioneira RS.1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law No. 4,595/64, which imposed normative restrictions on the operation of credit cooperatives. Law No. 5,764/71 which defined the legal regime for cooperative societies. 1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives. The promulgation of the 1988 Constitution represented, for credit cooperativism, the possibility of achieving the operational autonomy desired since the origins of the movement in Brazil. 1995 Constitution of Bansicredi, the first private cooperative bank in Brazil, responsible for establishing financial autonomy for cooperatives and allow more efficient access to the financial market and special financing programs.11 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 2022 2008 Constitution of Sicredi Participações - SicrediPar. 2018 Completion of the migration process of cooperatives and Central Sicredi North/Northeast.

Find out more about our history in the publication A Trajetória do Sicredi: https://www.sicredi.com.br/trajetoria/ 12 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISM1 Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone. While other financial institutions, for example, close agreements with large companies to offering a salary account obligatory for your employees, in a credit union membership happens differently. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose whether to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity for their members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives can be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. In this way, each financial product or service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in the assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as election of leaders, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by the ACI (International Cooperative Alliance) in 1995. At Sicredi, they direct and support us in generating positive impact:13 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 20225 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Pencils, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their region. 3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pockets, as decided democratically in the assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its its associates, in a model of democratic management.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of advancement of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other artisans got together and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each member contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business totally outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives for understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved.14 120 YEARS OF COOPERATIVISMOur cooperative essence VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM As we exercise our active role as associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in the cooperative and the use of financial solutions that promote member businesses, community growth and the development of people in the region. Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we expand the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperatives in Brazil, summarizes this view: 15 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 2022The cooperative is not from Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais or any other state in which it is located. The cooperative belongs to the member. Wherever there are members there is a cooperative.” Adelar José Parmeggiani President Sicredi UniEstados “Not only to work for myself, but for others or for the common good” As can be seen, solidarity and responsibility towards society society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present from the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism.16 SICREDI UNIESTADOS NUMBERS 61 agencies in the states of RS, SC and MG 143 thousand members R$ 5.6 billion total assets OUR COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS ________ 18 Profile _____________________________________________ 18 Regional Operation __________________________________ 19 HIGHLIGHTS IN 2022 ________________________________ 2002 Our Cooperativa Sicredi UniEstados18 OUR COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOSMission As a cooperative system, value relationships, offer financial solutions to aggregate income and contribute to improving the quality of life of associates and society.

It was another initiative that aimed to give a gift to the associate who invests in Sicredi. Thousands of gifts were distributed, totaling an investment of over R$1.2 million. The promotion ran until September 31, 2022 and included members from the three states covered by Sicredi UniEstados: Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais. For the president of Sicredi UniEstados, Adelar José Parmeggiani, the Capitalize and Win promotion was another way of valuing and giving gifts to members. “The great difference of this promotion was that when investing in Social Capital, the member took the gift home immediately, without the need to participate in a draw”, highlighted Adelar. INTEREST ON CAPITAL More than R$ 22 million. This is the amount that Sicredi UniEstados credited on December 20, 2022 in the quota capital of its more than 140 thousand members. The amount corresponds to 12.12% remuneration on the share capital and the portion that each member received was distributed proportionally to the value of their individual share capital. Payment reaffirms transparency in resource management and highlights the importance of each member's participation in the cooperative. According to the president of Sicredi UniEstados, Adelar José Parmeggiani, with the credit realized, members increase their quotas capital, further reinforcing the role of business owners. “This is the great difference of credit cooperatives, because, while in traditional banks the financial results go to shareholders, in cooperatives it is shared with members”, says Parmeggiani. 22 OUR COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS In 2022, Sicredi UniEstados continued to support and value sport in the regions where it operates, with sponsorships from clubs that compete in major championships and also with actions small, Sicredi UniEstados will have a Conservation and Memory Center Communication and Marketing Team with advisors from Catavento Atlântico FutsalWe consider that history is part of the experiences of individuals in societies and based on this assumption, Sicredi UniEstados will open in 202 3 its Conservation and Memory Center (CCM) and also its Memorial.

On account of our cooperative nature, since our constitution we have kept a close eye on our impacts. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social, and governance) seeks to demonstrate that the long-term survival of organizations depends on them generating value, also in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the market's “ESG vision”, understanding it as the management itself for business sustainability. Sicredi's three essential strategic guidelines, which guide everything we do: Mission, Vision and Values: describe the guidelines that guide the our business and guide our development in practice. Based on our guidelines, we build the systemic documents and policies that guide our strategy, decision making, operation and conduct. The Sustainability Policy establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in the relationship with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact and reducing our adverse impact. To guide our sustainable development strategy, we have established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.33 COOPERATIVA SICREDI UNIESTADOS 2022We have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicredi's material themes, that is, the themes most relevant to Sicredi's sustainability.
