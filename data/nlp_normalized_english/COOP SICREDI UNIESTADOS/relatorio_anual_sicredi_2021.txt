In 2021, the PF Platform gained strength and we implemented it in 100% of our agencies. More than 4 thousand accounts were opened on the new platform, which provided these members with an experience of greater agility and autonomy. According to Volmar Machado, executive director of Sicredi Information Technology, “All the internal transformation carried out allows us to provide products and services that serve different profiles of people, taking into account aspects of the local economy and its strengthening.

Open Finance, without forgetting the commitment and maturity of the cooperative financial institution with security and respect for the privacy of information.”Open Finance Zero Tariff In 2021, we maintained the exemption from Relationship Baskets for individual members and exemption from card annual fees international credit, generating more savings and benefits for everyone. This reinforces our commitment to financial inclusion in communities. Since the 2000s, the Central Bank has raised debates about regulation that today resulted in Open Finance. But it was from 2019 onwards that the institution announced the creation of the so-called BC Agenda, which aimed to develop a set of measures aimed at better integration of increasingly open information systems. The model has enhanced the entry and strengthening of new characters in the financial scene, especially fintechs, digital banks and technology companies that add facilities to the entire transaction system. Open finance, or open financial system, allows the sharing of data on financial products and information, through the integration of technological platforms and infrastructures of participating institutions and other financial services companies authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil. The initiative's principle is that the customer and/or associate has more autonomy and control over their data and decides when and how who wishes to share them, as long as it is for specific purposes. As a form of legal guarantees for the expansion of this model, the General Data Protection Law was created in August 2018, made official two years later, in September 2020. Fully integrated into the Open Finance implementation process in Brazil, Sicredi presents a portal about the Central Bank's recent innovation, which provides, through videos and other content, information about what the initiative is and its benefits for consumers.31 Responsible Solutions Safra Plan An agribusiness partner for more than 40 years, Sicredi UniEstados has already made available this year the 2021/2022 harvest, which began in July 2021, more than R$237 million to producers, with resources made available in approximately 3,100 operations.
