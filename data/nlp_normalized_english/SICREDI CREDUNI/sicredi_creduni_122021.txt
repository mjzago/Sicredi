The year 2021 was marked by resumption. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of economic activity in the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our lines Traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the Public Power's emergency program lines. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs when resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (automatic teller machines, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow most operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating in person at all branches, following the protocols health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of resumption, we highlight the following administrative facts: immersion in Sicredi's administrative culture such as learning processes, procedures and products, encouraging the use of digital media (Mobille Banking application and Whatsapp Enterprise, Sicredi Subscription Portal, PIX, Sicredi Conecta , between others); provision of remote services and signing documents electronically; granting credit; and investment in term deposits through alternative channels and provision of emergency credit under more accessible conditions. On another front, the cooperative worked on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates. Below we list the main social businesses carried out in 2021: partnership with Sescoop to offer Administration and Fiscal Council courses; encouraging the professional training of members and their dependents through partnerships with Senac, Sebrae and Senai; distribution of "Turma da Mônica" comic books on financial education; participation in the “More Solidarity Christmas” campaign, giving gifts to the elderly, children and needy people in the community; and sponsorship of events promoted by cooperative members, both scientific and social and charitable. The cooperative acted strongly during this time of confronting the pandemic. Between the actions, we highlight the support for hospitals in the region that work on the front line in the fight against Covid-19, where PPE and wheelchairs were donated. We also donate basic food baskets to needy families in the city of Campina Grande. Furthermore, we maintained all the health measures implemented during the 2020 financial year, which enabled a safe and quality environment, without risks to the health of associates and employees.

Below we present the total remuneration of key management personnel: Remuneration 2021-12-31 Operational Risk operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties resulting from activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal regulations and external, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's staff; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on the Institution's risk and control culture; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of activities of the institution and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to assess, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue delivery of products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) the institution's main business processes are identified as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the business continuity strategies adopted are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard provide for the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of entities.I - Capital Management Structure For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital held by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. Processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with best practices market, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by minimum legal capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above the minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risk appetite, aiming to maintain capital for support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Periodic management reports on capital adequacy for the board of directors and the board of directors;NOTE 24 – RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Sicredi System considers the priority risk management in the conduct of its activities and business, adopting practices in absolute accordance with the precepts of the Basel Accords. In this way, it has specialized areas for the management of these risks, centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A.
