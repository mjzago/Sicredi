Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of their determination.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. They are demonstrated by known or calculable values, including, when applicable, charges and monetary variations on a pro rata-die basis incurred, deducted from the corresponding expenses to be appropriated. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts.

After analyzing the scenarios by the cooperative's committees (Executive Board and Board of Directors), the additional balance line adopted since June 2020 was reversed. Considering that the uncertainties regarding the previous Pandemic scenario were significantly reduced after the historic After two periods, defaults increased, thus materializing part of the negative expectations regarding the market. As provided in Art. 6th of CMN Resolution No. 4,846/20, the provision in the face of loss for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE) must only apply to the portion of credit whose credit risk is assumed by the Cooperative and these values ​​are being presented together with the amount provisioned for operations credit and others credits.
