Base for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Council of Accounting, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards.

Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted.

When preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless the management intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Distortions can be arising from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, as well as obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We assessed the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management.  We conclude on the suitability of use, by the management a, the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inappropriate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the presentation objective proper. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work. Brasília, March 2, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative União - Sicredi União RS/ESFinancial Statements 2022 Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Confederation Sicredi Accounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendency of Controllership We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machine and 100% digital account, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborate with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Banks Central countries around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March of this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the cycle of rising interest rates with the Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October's reading, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. The year 2022 was marked by the strengthening of virtuous cycle, through continued expansion to Espírito Santo and development of the regions where Rio Grande do Sul operates. The virtuous cycle is strengthened when members invest and save and others use this amount in the form of credit to make their dreams come true , buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and is transformed into the provision of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Sicredi União RS/ES carried out several communication campaigns encouraging association, investments and saving resources. In the continuity of the expansion to Espírito Santo, we began the activities of physical spaces and delivered five more branches: the first in Alegre, Apiacá, Castelo and Guaçuí and the fourth branch in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim. In Rio Grande do Sul, we opened a new structure at the Santa Rosa – Centro branch. With these new structures, the cooperative ended the year with 60 branches, 51 in RS and 9 in ES. We also have 2 mobile agencies equipped with operational systems, 1 in RS and another in ES, which are available to serve members and communities. We value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate are premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: We strengthened cooperative development programs: Grow, Belong, Cooperation in Ponta do Lápis, A União Faz a Vida, School Cooperatives, Dia C and Social Fund. We highlight here that in the Pertencer Program we sought to engage members in the Core Assembly that was held digitally with the participation of more than 13 thousand members and we had the election of the new Board of Directors – Management 2022-2026. In the A União Faz a Vida Program, in 26 years of existence, it impacts the lives of more than 10 thousand children and adolescents and 1 thousand educators. Our performance is in 26 municipalities and 86 schools. In 2022, we held a cycle of online dialogues and in-person meetings with all teachers participating in the program. We delivered 11,000 sustainable t-shirts to students and educators, which resulted in the planting of more than 22,000 trees, as each t-shirt contained a seed and the supplier planted the same quantity. Furthermore, we made an important delivery to the region where we operate, inaugurating the Cooperation monument in Santo Cristo, in bee shape - mascot of the Program, alluding to the 25th anniversary in 2021. The action took place in Santo Cristo, as this is the municipality where the program began in Brazil. In the school cooperatives Program, it was a remarkable year due to the founding of the first school cooperative of Sicredi União RS/ES, Cooperall, which has as its object of learning the production and sale of biscuits. On Day C, the Cooperative promoted, together with various cooperatives, voluntary initiatives such as revitalization of public spaces and philanthropic entities, as well as cleaning streets and riverbanks, planting trees, distributing plant seedlings and recreational activities. And in the Social Fund we support 304 environmental, cultural, educational, sports, health and safety projects. Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Best Companies to Work For, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had the corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in physical and digital service. We thank our associates, collaborators and partners for their dedication and continuous work. Together we will continue to build a more prosperous society.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in acts not cooperatives.

After analyzing the scenarios by the cooperative's committees (Executive Board and Board of Directors), the strategy was adopted to increase the rating provision percentage (except for <AA=), as a way of protecting the cooperative for future and eventual increases in default.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or loss account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare an implementation plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the implementation plan for said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022) : Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan.
