A year of strengthening the virtuous cycle, which brought 25 thousand new people to cooperativism in the Union RS/ES, concluding with 189 thousand members, which generated a result of over R$114 million, 10.5% higher compared to 2021, solidifying our cooperative operating model. Reader, may you invest some of your daily time in reading of the report. Here, through the stories of our members and the actions reported, you will understand why the cooperative business model generates a virtuous cycle. This model, which has existed for more than a century and remains modern and sustainable, as it is transparent and centered on human beings and cooperation between people, where by exercising our active role as associates, acting as owners of the business, we make the financial lives of everyone more cooperative and prosperous. 5 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES: Annual Report 2022While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to make their dreams come true, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. In 2022, we will continue to grow and generate prosperity in Rio Grande do Sul and Espírito Santo. Our credit portfolio reached R$4.1 billion, 29.63% higher than in 2021. Net equity, which directly represents the solidity of the institution, exceeded R$675 million, growing 14.42%. Total assets reached R$5.4 billion, an increase of 34.17%. And managed resources, which represent investments in the Cooperative, grew 40.9%, closing the year at R$4.9 billion. We continued to expand our physical presence, ending 2022 with 60 branches, 51 in Rio Grande do Sul and nine in Espírito Santo, where we completed a year of expansion. In the river Grande do Sul, we inaugurated the new building of the Santa Rosa Centro agency, which has been operating for 40 years in the municipality of Santa Rosa/RS and, in the State of Capixaba, we inaugurated five new agencies, the first being in Alegre, Guaçuí, Apiacá and Castelo and the fourth from Cachoeiro de Itapemirim. We are proud to increasingly provide opportunities for this approach to Capixaba culture for all members to learn about, which is why we brought in the report four stories from members of Espírito Santo, which show the results of our recent actions and the potential of the State. At all times, in our actions and at our physical or digital service points, we remain focused on the satisfaction of our members. This is the main quest of all of our more than 900 employees, with an effort that was reflected in the 76.3% satisfaction rate of our associates, generated from the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. Surely, at the end of the report you will understand why together we build a more prosperous society. All of this is only possible due to the trust of our associates and collaborators, and shows that our journey continues on the path of prosperity. The more people who are inspired to be part of this virtuous cycle of cooperativism, the more prosperity each of us will have, our family and our region will have. Throughout the pages you will learn or remember everything we built together in 2022, what financial and non-financial results we generated. We are very grateful to everyone for the valuable constructions and we continue in 2023 excited to celebrate our 110 years, on July 6th. Happy reading!6 Sicredi Administrative Center, in Porto Alegre/RS.

Since 1902, we have worked to support the growth of our associates and bring sustainable development to the communities where we are present. In fact, we are the only financial institution physically present in 200 Brazilian municipalities. In 2022, we began operating in all states in the country. We generate value for these localities by raising and lending resources to members in the same regions. The permanence of these resources in place creates a virtuous cycle that stimulates income generation and a cycle of sustainable growth, with a greater supply of jobs, local products and economic development. We have a systemic operating model, in which each of our 105 cooperatives has the autonomy to operate locally, but has the support of the Sicredi Administrative Center in technology, security and solidity. financial. Cooperatives are responsible for implementing national strategies, taking local needs into account. Each cooperative is affiliated with one of our five regional centers, which are shareholders of SicrediPar, a holding company that coordinates, together with the cooperatives themselves, the System's strategic decisions. We also have specialized companies in our structure that offer credibility and reliability to members, such as Confederação Sicredi, Sicredi Fundo Guarantors, Fundação Sicredi, Banco Cooperativo Sicredi and its controlled companies — the Asset Administrator, the Consortium Administrator and the Insurance Broker —, located in Porto Alegre (RS), at the Sicredi Administrative Center.

A journey that was closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for associates and communities where we are present. Our origins occurred with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the Jesuit priest Theodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small owners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and Holland, learning about the importance of actions cooperatives for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, they put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They started a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model was taken forward, overcoming the challenges that emerged in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. 1 Headquarters (Imperial Line): 1903 to 1933.11 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES: Annual Report 202211 Força Cooperativa Monument, in honor of Cooperativism in Nova Petrópolis.12 SICREDI12 VALUES • Unrestricted preservation of the cooperative nature of the business; • Respect for the individuality of the member; • Valuing and developing people; • Preservation of the institution as a System; OUR CAUSES Education: We believe that investing Education in the present makes a difference in the future.

With our local operations, we are closer to our associates and the community in the Northwest and Missions of Rio Grande do Sul and South of Espírito Santo. With this, we work towards the development of these regions by understanding the needs of our members and offering the most appropriate solutions for each moment. Our results, presented in this report, and which go far beyond financial ones, show the importance and value of believing that We can build a more prosperous society together through cooperativism. We are one of the five century-old cooperatives in the System, and we will complete 110 years in 2023. The history of our Cooperative began in 1913, in Cerro Largo/RS, by Father Theodor Amstad. In the System, together with Sicredi Pioneira, we are the only ones founded with the presence of Amstad.

In 1905, the priest made his first trip to Colônia Serro Azul and, on July 6, 1913, the the founding of the Caixa Econômica and Loans of Serro Azul – Spar und Darlenhenskasse, initially only for school-age children, the origin of our Sicredi União RS/ES. In 1980, our Cooperative participated in the creation of Cocecrer-RS (Cooperativa Central de Crédito Rural do Rio Grande do Sul Ltda), currently Central Sicredi Sul. In 1992, it participated, with all the cooperatives in the system, in the adoption of the Sicredi brand, becoming part of the national system, with specialized companies and financial instruments that increase the security of our members and strengthen our local operations. Another important milestone in our history occurred in 2010, when the cooperatives Sicredi Grande Santa Rosa, Sicredi Serro Azul and Sicredi Missões joined together, forming Sicredi União RS. In 2020 we concluded an important moment in history: the physical presence in all 39 municipalities in the region where we operate in Rio Grande do Sul and on December 3, 2020 the associates approved, in Extraordinary Assembly, the expansion of our activities to the southern region of the State of Espírito Santo, changing the area of ​​activity to another 22 municipalities. As a result, the Cooperative was renamed the União Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative – Sicredi União RS/ES.

Therefore, while we evolve to meet the needs of an increasingly dynamic and digital environment, with growth above the market, we also maintain our roots in the principles and values ​​of cooperativism, which inspire our century-old business. Through our performance in the system, but looking at the locally, we generate value and transform the communities where we are present, reaffirming the cooperative ideal of our founders. It is a virtuous cycle that promotes economic, social and environmental development, contributing to the sustainable development of our society. By playing our active role as associates, acting as business owners, we make everyone's financial lives more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to make your dreams come true, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and is transformed into the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. This year, we brought you, reader, an example of a virtuous cycle among associates in our region that you you can check it out below. Ivo Aloisio Konzen is an associate of Cerro Largo/RS and by saving his money with us he contributes to the rural producer Matheus Foletto Perin, from São Luiz Gonzaga/RS could finance the purchase of inputs to develop soybean crops. Matheus purchased inputs from the local economy, contributing to Samanta Lorenzi Dalmolin's business, the company Super Safra, in São Luiz Gonzaga/RS. Samanta is also our associate and invests in Sicredi. As it prospers, it brings more investments to the municipality and region, creates jobs and continues to invest with Sicredi, allowing other members can make their dreams come true through credit. With all these movements, we generated results and were able to invest in social programs for the community, such as the A União Faz a Vida Program and the Social Fund. In chapter 6 you can see the stories: of the Boa Vista School, of Senador Salgado Filho, and the José João Bisognin School, which were able to participate in the A União Faz a Vida Program, and also the story of the Princesa Isabel school, in the interior of Santa Rosa , which can build a garden with resources from the Social Fund.28 OUR COOPERATIVE When good multiplies, stories like that of Ivo Aloisio Konzen, associate and saver at Sicredi, in the municipality of Cerro Largo/RS, are told. Ivo reports that he had the pleasure of following the growth and development of Sicredi in the region since the 1970s and developed a fondness for cooperativism: “I see that the cooperative process has a great advantage, as it seeks out members who have available resources, applications It is investments in the Cooperative, which uses this same resource to pass on to other members to manage their businesses, finance their crops, construction projects, industry, working capital... One helps the other”. The retired bank employee, who has always been involved in social institutions such as the Home for the Elderly, the hospital and the Lions Club of Cerro Largo, also saw Sicredi as an opportunity to provide resources to entities through the Social Fund. This experience awakened in Ivo the feeling of duty to the community, and he started to invest his own resources in the Cooperative, with the aim of supporting local development. By investing in savings, Ivo allows Matheus to finance his farming through the Cooperative's funding. THE STORY OF IVO, FROM CERRO LARGO/RS “Investing a resource in the Cooperative is a way of being able to contribute, with my small leftovers, so that the productive sector, commerce, and people who need money can have the reach of this resource.” Ivo, Sicredi associate, being assisted by collaborator Jaqueline Dapper, at the Cerro Largo/RS branch.

With financial solutions from Sicredi, Matheus is able to work more safely in the Farm's operations. The Cooperative's products provide greater peace of mind for the business, as in addition to Sicredi offering agricultural insurance, it also enables, through funding, price bargains when purchasing products in cash from companies. Matheus' relationship with Sicredi exceeds eight years and the associate reports a good relationship in terms of service. “I feel at home. When I get there, everyone knows us. We are well attended to, both at the checkout, as in self-service, with agricultural staff…”. With the costs, Matheus makes investments in agricultural products and inputs for farming, purchased from the company Super Safra, owned by Samanta, also a member of Sicredi.

Super Safra's trajectory counts on Sicredi offering financial solutions for the company and its customers, helping in difficult periods such as drought and advising members on investments. Samanta highlights the similarity between the company and the Cooperative in the search for excellence in the provision of services. “Credibility is one of the words that you can only build by fulfilling what you promise, it is paying correctly, honoring the actions. ” The company director welcomes the Cooperative's social programs, reinforces the importance of Sicredi serving all types of customers and hopes for the Cooperative's constant evolution. “Because if Sicredi is better with the clients we establish, we all benefit from it. The companies, the client itself, the rural producers and Sicredi itself.”With the investments made by Super Safra, the generation of jobs that the company does and all the movement with the Cooperative is that the virtuous cycle continues to turn and, thus, it also becomes possible to finance all cooperative development programs, such as the Social Fund and A União Faz a Vida, which we will see in the next chapters with the stories of the Boa Vista School, in Senador Salgado Filho, the José João Bisognin School, in Giruá, and the Princesa Isabel School, in the interior of Santa Rosa/RS. Samanta, associate from São Luiz Gonzaga/RS. Find out more about this story by watching the video.

Furthermore, through our non-financial solutions, we extend the positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that cooperativism constitutes a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. This is how the results, which you will see below, are possible and generate a cycle of prosperity. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: As you can see, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperativism — were already present since the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over these years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact for society, through the essence of cooperativism. “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good.”32 OUR COOPERATIVEOur Numbers Check out the main results of this virtuous cycle here and on the following pages, where you will find a general summary of the financial performance of Sicredi União RS/ES and our main positive impact indicators.

Due to our cooperative nature, since our constitution we have had a attentive to our impacts, aiming for sustainability. This concern was materialized in a robust sustainability strategy, which incorporates the best management practices on the topic and is based on four pillars: economic, social, environmental and governance. The expression ESG (environmental, social and governance) seeks to demonstrate that the long-term survival of organizations depends on them also generating value in these three aspects. Our strategy incorporates the “ESG vision” of the market, understanding it as the management itself for the sustainability of the business. Sicredi's three essential strategic guidelines, which guide everything we do: Mission, Vision and Values: describe the guidelines that guide our business and guide our development in practice. Based on our guidelines, we build the systemic documents and policies that guide our strategy, decision-making, operations and conduct. The Policy of Sustainability establishes the principles and guidelines that guide decision-making in all areas of the business and in relationships with interested parties, with the aim of expanding our positive impact and reducing our adverse impact. To guide our sustainable development strategy, we have established our sustainability drivers and focal themes.Our Sustainability Strategy41 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES: Annual Report 2022We have three drivers divided into 12 focal themes, which are Sicredi's material themes, that is, the themes most relevant to Sicredi's sustainability.

Those principles are described in the Code of Conduct, which guides our moral and ethical conduct. The document is made up of a set of guidelines that guide the actions and decisions of all Sicredi members, regardless of their roles and responsibilities, in addition to internal and external relations. The Code presents the commitments to corporate governance, transparency, equity, accountability and responsibility necessary in the attitude of each of our employees collaborators. It also addresses the topic of sustainability, highlighting the preservation of the environment and the non-tolerance of slave and child labor and corruption. The document, together with other internal regulations, also guides employees, business partners and members of senior management, including advisors, on how to avoid conflicts of interest and situations that involve the generation of benefits for any party. To prevent situations like these, our processes internal areas are defined with due segregation. All of our employees undergo basic training in Sicredi Aprendi, our corporate learning system, in which we cover the content of the Code of Conduct. At the end of the training, each employee electronically records their knowledge and adoption of the principles stipulated in the document in their daily work. We also have a Corruption Prevention Policy, which establishes guidelines, responsibilities and minimum rules to be followed at all levels and entities of Sicredi, as a mechanism to prevent and combat corruption. To learn about the Code of Conduct and the Corruption Prevention Policy, click here.54 RELATIONSHIP AND COOPERATIVISMReporting To meet demands regarding the Code of Conduct, we provide our reporting channel, with options for registering questions, compliments, complaints and suggestions related to the topic. The channel must be used to record situations with signs of illegality of any nature, and the user can choose whether to be identified or remain anonymous. The Compliance team is responsible for managing the records of complaints, their monitoring, investigation and treatment until finalization, maintaining integrity, security and confidentiality. The area has independence, autonomy and direct access to the Executive Board of the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS) and other directors of the entities that make up the System.

Access the reporting channel by clicking here or by calling 0800 646 2519. In order to strengthen the our governance model and provide more security to associates, we reinforced our technologies and internal processes, prioritizing the cybersecurity of our services and products. Compliance To maintain our commitment to meeting legal and regulatory requirements, we seek to integrate this requirement into our business environment, promoting an organizational culture that values ​​ethics and integrity, aimed at preserving our image and reputation. We are committed to complying with the international recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (FATF) and complying with current regulations, preventing our cooperative from being used as a means to carry out illicit activities. When contracting products and services, we adopt practices to inhibit misconduct, illicit acts or contraventions - to civil, environmental, tax, labor legislation, obligations to the relationship - as well as to anti-corruption and other standards, seeking to establish accountability rules direct and/or indirect of those involved.55 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES: Annual Report 2022In addition, We carry out monthly monitoring through a specific system integrated with our core systems, which cross-checks the records of financial transactions and the member's income or revenue. This procedure allows the identification of atypicalities, which are evaluated individually. The engagement of our employees in topics related to compliance occurs through training on risk management, ethics and prevention of the crime of money laundering. With the aim of train and raise awareness of our employees about the importance of preventing and combating illegal acts, we encourage and monitor the completion of the Sicredi Aprendi regulatory training track, which offers training that addresses anti-corruption and compliance issues, namely: Code of Conduct, Compliance and Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing – PLD/FT. Data Protection We continue to implement the Data Protection and Privacy Program, which seeks comply with the General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD) based on integrated risk management. We reinforce understanding on the topic with training for employees and adapt all our activities in accordance with legislation, protecting members, collaborators, suppliers and other stakeholders.

Each ecological t-shirt came with a numbered card with native seeds from the Atlantic Forest, thus contributing to reforestation. Furthermore, it is made from natural cotton fabric, where some chemical processes have been nullified, reducing pollution and the amount of water used in production. In the social sphere, by purchasing the t-shirt we contribute to the work of thousands of families and, finally, in the economic sense, we reduce the costs of this action. Sustainable t-shirts with tree seeds. The Cooperative saved with the action: 74,095 liters of water and 3058 KW of energy.
