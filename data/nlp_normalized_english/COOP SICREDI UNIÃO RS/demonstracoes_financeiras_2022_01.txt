Sicredi, as a cooperative financial institution, is committed to the growth of its members and the development of the regions where it operates. We remain firm in our commitment to contributing to the economic activity of communities, considering their different realities and needs, constantly seeking to create opportunities for connection between members and the latest trends technological technologies, stimulating income generation and local economic and social development, with the aim of having a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable society every day. Close relationships are essential for us to continue cooperating with communities, even more so in a period of economic recovery, offering financial solutions for micro and small businesses, small rural producers, self-employed professionals and other associates. We did all this without forgetting to look at the impact socio-environmental aspect of our financial solutions. Macroeconomic Scenario In the last two years, inflation has re-emerged as a global problem. The combination of demand stimuli (monetary and fiscal) with the supply bottlenecks generated by the pandemic created a scenario of rapid appreciation of commodities and high consumer inflation. The war between Ukraine and Russia, which broke out between February and March this year, worsened this situation, as it increased the prices of several commodities even further, as Both countries are important producers of items such as wheat, corn, oil and natural gas, in addition to putting the supply of these products at risk. Thus, persistent and high inflation continued to be the main characteristic of the global economic scenario in the first half of this year. In Brazil, the first half of the year saw continued economic recovery, driven by the reopening of the economy. The success of vaccination allowed the country to go through the wave of the Ômicron variant, without the need for major containment measures. As a result, the economic sectors most linked to the movement of people and the provision of face-to-face services managed to recover much of the level of activity they had before the pandemic. Growth and Expansion Reinforcing the importance of credit cooperatives, in April 2022 the Sicredi System arrived in the state of Roraima and began to be present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, completing its national expansion. The growth of the physical service network is aligned to the objectives of being close to meeting the needs of communities, contributing to the local economy. Currently, there are more than 2.3 thousand branches, in more than 1.6 thousand municipalities, with more than 200 of these being the only financial institution physically present. This expansion will also be reflected in the number of members and in June it reached the mark of 6 million, a growth of 15% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which represented an increase of more than 796 thousand new members. With roots in the countryside, long partnership with agribusiness, we were recognized by the Central Bank as the 2nd largest financial institution in granting credit for agribusiness. Also, this semester, we ranked 4th among the best financial institutions in Brazil in the World’s Best Banks 2022 ranking, carried out by Forbes in partnership with Statista. Our members count on a solid cooperative financial institution with evaluation from the main risk rating agencies in the world, having Fitch's AA(bra) and “Strong” rating for itsAsset, also granted by the agency. It is also rated by Moody's (Aa2) and Standart & Poor's (AAA).

Collaborate with development and generate positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation.

NOTE 04 – CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS When preparing the cash flow statements, the following amounts were classified as cash and cash equivalents:r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every semester. Significant items subject to these Estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to the probable value of realization or recovery, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I-Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for constitution of provision in function delay in payment of the principal installment or charges for operations, the provision is calculated based on the Administration's judgment regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, the debtors and guarantors, the periods of delay and the economic group, observing the parameters established in Resolutions no. 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00 of the CMN. The details of the provision for losses are presented in NOTE 07; II-Provision for civil risks, tax and labor: Based on loss forecasts evaluated by the Administration, constituting a provision for tax, civil, tax and labor demands through legal assessments. The assessment of loss prognoses takes into account the probability of the entity's disbursements for each procedural element and may incur a high degree of judgment the greater the uncertainty. The details of provisions and contingent liabilities are presented in NOTE 15; III- Reduction in the recoverable value of intangible assets and other assets: the test for loss due to reduction in the recoverable value of these assets is carried out, at least annually, in order to determine whether there is any indication that an asset may have suffered devaluation. When the recoverable value of these assets cannot be obtained through external sources, the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets may involve considerable judgments, especially when measuring potential future economic benefits. associated;q) Provision for civil, tax and labor risks Accounting practices for recording, measuring and disclosing contingent assets and liabilities, and also legal obligations, are applied in accordance with the criteria defined by Technical Pronouncement CPC 25, issued by the Accounting Pronouncements Committee (CPC ), which was approved by Resolution No. 3,823/09, namely: •Contingent assets are recognized only when there are real guarantees or favorable court decisions, passed into court. Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved are measurable with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as payable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. p) Taxes and contributions Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) are levied on the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ is 15%, plus an additional 10% and the CSLL in which the rate went from 15% to 20% from July 2021 and will return to 15% from January 2022, applied to the profit earned, after base adjustments decalculation provided for in legislation and compensation of tax losses and negative calculation basis of CSLL from previous years, this deduction being limited to 30% of taxable profit.

In June 2020, after analyzing the scenarios by the Cooperative's collegiate bodies (Executive Board and Board of Directors), it was adopted The strategy is to increase the provision percentage in all ratings from that month onwards, as a way of protecting the Cooperative for future and possible increases in default. Considering that in June 2022 the scenario of uncertainty in the economy remains and the Cooperative continues to expand to the state of Espírito Santo, where there is still no broad knowledge of this market, the additional provisioning levels were maintained. As provided in Art. 5th of BACEN Resolution No. 4,800/20 provision in the face of loss for operations included in the Emergency Employment Support Program (PESE), it must only apply to the amount equivalent to the Equity allocated for this purpose.

The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, evaluation and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by legal minimum capital requirements; •Capital targets at levels above the minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risky appetite, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Management reports capital adequacy periodicals for management and the board of directors; II - Operational Risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages third parties arising from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's staff; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on the Institution's risk and control culture; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to evaluate, manage and monitor operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular operation of the institution. NOTE 25 – RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Sicredi System considers risk management to be a priority in the conduct of its business activities, adopting practices in absolute accordance with the precepts of the Basel Accords. In this way, it has specialized areas for managing these risks, centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. Among the main risks managed by the institution, the highlights are the Capital Management Structure, Operational Risk, Business Continuity, Market, Interest Rate Variations, Liquidity, Credit, Social and Environmental Risk, Compliance Risk and Information Security Risk, the main aspects of which are presented below: I - Structure of Capital Management For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital maintained by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. Capital management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of operations, the complexity of products and the scale of the System's risk exposure. Centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management.
