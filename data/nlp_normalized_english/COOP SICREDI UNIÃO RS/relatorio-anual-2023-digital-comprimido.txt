It remained firm like the rocks that are present throughout the state's landscape and we created an intense rhythm, always present in the daily life of Espírito Santo. Here, we provide an assessment until 2023, taking a look back and bringing data from the last year, which shows how we are building together an even more prosperous society through Cooperativism. Since 2020, Sicredi has been expanding its operations to the State of Espírito Santo, bringing the benefits of credit cooperatives to the five regions of Brazil, from the countryside to the cities. The initiative is in line with Sicredi's strategy of being close to communities, providing consultative service and contributing to local socioeconomic development. In the same year, when our Cooperative closed its physical presence in all municipalities in its area of ​​operation in Rio Grande do Sul, it was studying the opportunity to expand to this State. 35 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES The opening of the first branches in the South of the State is a milestone for Sicredi and our Cooperative. It goes far beyond the expansion and growth of Sicredi, it represents the beginning of work to collectively build more prosperous communities. It's the opportunity we have to take cooperativism to more people and places, helping to add income and improve the quality of life of Espírito Santo.

We believe in relationships and proximity as a business model to add income and improve the lives of associates and society. This balanced and sustainable model, adopted by our Cooperative in the expansion in Espírito Santo, it has proven to be one of the most assertive forms of action. According to market estimates, while other financial institutions take two to four years to reach the balance point between operating revenues and expenses, the Cooperative has taken an average of 18 months, as in this period of operation our branches have already demonstrated positive operational results , a fact that motivates us to follow this model, always putting people in the center of our strategy.NUMBERS IN ESPÍRITO SANTO 171 employees Municipalities with Agencies Municipalities with OperationsESPIRIT SANTOSão José do CalçadoGuaçuíDores do Rio PretoDivino de São LourençoIbitiramaIrupiIbatiba Iúna Muniz Freire AlegreCastelo Cachoeiro de ItapemirimJerônimo Monteiro MuquiAtílio Vivácqua Mimoso do Sul Apiacá Bom Jesus do Norte President KennedyMarataízesItapemirimVargem Alta39 SICREDI UNIÃO RS /ES SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES 3923.1 thousand members 9 municipalities with agencies12 agencies 22 municipalities482.7 million resources administered 379.6 million credit ESPÍRITO SANTOSão José do CalçadoGuaçuíDores do Rio PretoDivino de São LourençoIbitiramaIrupiIbatiba Iúna Muniz Freire AlegreCastelo Cachoeiro de ItapemirimJerônimo Monteiro MuquiAtílio Vivácqua Mimoso do Sul Apiacá Bom Jesus do NortePresident KennedyMarataízesItapemirimVar gem Alta40 ANNUAL REPORT 2023 - CELEBRATIVE When Sicredi came to Cachoeiro, 2 years ago, what attracted me a lot attention was humility. We see no difference between talking to a director and talking to a business manager. I usually say that there is the banking system, the cooperative system and, there is Sicredi, as it stands out for the way it treats and talks to its members. We also saw that Sicredi would be very important for HIFA (Hospital Materno Infantil Francisco de Assis), where I work, and for our employees, and so we had the opportunity to form a partnership for payroll. payment, which started in December 2023. For me, Sicredi is different from any bank, any cooperative, it has very easy language for everyone. I also see the difference when I need to turn to the institution, whether calling to ask a simple question about investments or financing, or a term we saw on television, and Sicredi answers without wanting anything in return. My experience was the best possible and it is an institution that I am proud to be a part of associated. Anyone who has the opportunity to get to know Sicredi will not regret it. Christian Lessa da Silva Associate in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim/ES.PEOPLE IN THE CENTER: SIMPLE AND CLOSE SERVICE41 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES THE BENEFITS OF CREDIT COOPERATIVISM From 2019 to 2023, a series of studies were carried out on the Benefits of Credit Cooperatives. The first survey concluded that credit cooperatives increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of municipalities by 5.6%, it creates 6.2% more formal job vacancies and increases the number of commercial establishments by 15.7%, therefore stimulating local entrepreneurship. The next surveys were related to the “Impact on banking services” and it was observed that, while traditional banks have on average a minimum limit of eight thousand inhabitants to open a branch, a credit cooperative has the capacity to open in municipalities from 2. 3 thousand inhabitants. The comparison in terms of income also drew attention in the research results by pointing out that cooperatives are able to operate in cities with a lower GDP, starting at R$79 million, unlike public banks, where a minimum GDP of R$146 million is required and banks private sector, of R$220 million. The latest survey found that physical presence remains important for the effective financial inclusion of the population, even in the current context of increasing digitalization. When evaluating the behavior of members who now have an agency in their municipality, the research revealed that the average use of products increases 25% in two years, when compared to active members in municipalities without physical service. After five years, each member will be served with an average of seven financial products.SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2023 - CELEBRATIONThe Program has its own methodology, based on project-based pedagogy, encouraging cooperation, critical thinking, decision-making and citizenship: globalized knowledge. It values ​​knowledge obtained outside and inside school and can be applied in Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education and High School. In it, students are protagonists of the learning process and develop projects adapted to their curiosities and the reality of each community in which they work. Through them, children develop values ​​such as dialogue, justice, solidarity, entrepreneurship and respect for diversity. of educational, cultural, social and sustainable initiatives that keep the essence of cooperativism alive in the culture of our institution. Our initiatives and programs are aimed at positive impact on members and communities and, therefore, one of our differences is that, by joining and participating in Sicredi, the member contributes to the development of these programs. Below we present to you the Sicredi programs and initiatives that we developed at Sicredi União RS/ES, with the Crescer, Pertencer, Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis and Fundo Social programs being developed in all municipalities where we have agencies. The União Faz a Vida Program and Cooperativas Escolares are in some municipalities, which we will indicate starting on page 82. We have a commitment network made up of different audiences who work in favor of the Program. At the center of this network are the target audiences: educators, children and adolescents. development of cooperativism 43 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES Cooperation Monument, installed in Praça Dom Estanislau Kreutz, in Santo Cristo/RSO União Faz a Vida Program emerged in 1995 in Santo Cristo/RS, in the region where Sicredi União RS/ES operates , as a pilot project, and today it is in several places in Brazil. In our region of operation, we have the participation of 10,900 students, 998 teachers and 87 schools, in 26 municipalities. To mark where it all began, we installed, in the year 2022, in Santo Cristo the Cooperation Monument, sculpted in bronze by the Uruguayan sculptor Gustavo Nakle, representing the bee, the Program's mascot. She is the mascot because she is considered a citizen of the world, inhabiting practically all regions of the planet and, like cooperativism, can develop anywhere. Likewise, the Program sows new generations of young cooperatives and citizens. She lives in society and divides tasks, acting cooperatively. A Fundação Sicredi, in partnership with the Institute for the Development of Social Investment (IDIS), carried out a study on the social impact of the A União Faz a Vida Program, using scientific methodology, identifying the Social Return on Investment (SROI). The study revealed that the impacts of the Program remain at the same intensity in the lives of participants for a period of five to seven years, and that they correspond to four times the investment made.SICREDI GERA PROGRAM SOCIAL IMPACT FOUR TIMES BIGGER THAN THE AMOUNT INVESTED. R$7.8 million Invested in the last 6 years. 10.9 thousand students served in 2023. FOR EVERY R$1.00 INVESTED, R$4.07 IN SOCIAL IMPACTS ARE GENERATED.44 ANNUAL REPORT 2023 - CELEBRATIVETo reinforce our alignment with the principle of democratic management, the Pertencer Program encourages the participation of members in the assemblies and decision-making processes of cooperatives, including those related to management and development. Through it, we establish the rules of participation, guide our participatory management model and engage members. The Pertencer Program management tool allows us to monitor assemblies from the creation of the event, registration of voting agendas, reception and confirmation of presence of members. In addition to in-person assemblies, we have the Digital Assemblies Platform. Through it, we promote the democratic participation of associated with all the convenience of the digital model, reducing travel and facilitating access, in addition to promoting accessibility for those who may have limitations in participating in person. At Pertencer we also hold Relationship Meetings, which are a time to be close to members, to demonstrate our differences, the impacts that cooperativism brings to the community, as well as being an opportunity to listen to their needs and dreams for support them in their achievement. Relationship Meeting in Ubiretama/RS +29 thousand people Gathered at the Assembly in digital format. +31 thousand people In face-to-face Relationship meetings.45 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES The Crescer Program is a cooperative education initiative available to everyone: members, non-members, counselors, nucleus coordinators and collaborators. Through the Program, we provide experiences so that people learn more about Sicredi, its governance, benefits and differences in relation to other financial institutions. With Crescer, we aim to provide participants with educational training, improving their participation in the management and sustainable development of the cooperative. In the case of associates, we help them understand their role, qualifying the participation of each of them and giving them the opportunity to develop as future leaders. To align the Program’s strategy with our business, we have several materials that connect the theme of cooperativism to the five stages of relationships with our members and other stakeholders linked to the System: • Prospecting for members: introducing cooperativism to people who are not yet members. • Welcome: presentation of our competitive differences to new members. • Training of members: strengthening the member's relationship with Sicredi and the cooperative movement, bringing them closer to their cooperative so that they can participate as an associate. • Leadership training: development of leaders for the sustainability of our System, such as core coordinators and administration and tax advisors. • Training of employees: preparation of cooperative teams to carry out the other stages of the Program, together with members and the community. These stages are implemented considering the reality of each audience. In them, content is presented in a dynamic and interactive way in meetings. In addition, we also have specific training by segment: Grow for young people, women, farmers, individuals and legal entities to develop as future leaders. Meeting of the Crescer+ Program 1.3 thousand people trained in the program in 2023. R$ 24.5 thousand Invested in the program in 2023.46 ANNUAL REPORT 2023 - CELEBRATIVE Lecture on Financial Education With the purpose of cooperating towards a sustainable financial life, we count on the Cooperation in Ponta do Pencil, our Financial Education Program. Through it, we assume the role of transformative agents, with actions developed to connect us to the reality of associates, employees and communities, generating a positive impact on their lives. The Program unfolds in content for different audiences and has its own methodology supported by the concepts of behavioral sciences, considering emotional issues involved in decision-making and helping in the search for balance financial. In the Program, we use economic psychology and behavioral sciences with the aim of providing a better understanding of habits in relation to finances. After all, it is not enough to only address technical knowledge: we seek to provoke awareness that brings effective results. With the Program's actions, we share practices that can bring a more sustainable life to many people. The actions take place in the day-to-day work of the Cooperative, where our Employees are always willing and qualified to help associates in the sustainability of their financial lives. Our Program is for everyone. We want to help transform the financial lives of people in the communities in which we operate by providing more information, knowledge and good practices to improve our relationship with money.+5.9 thousand people had access to the program in 2023. 163 meetings Held in 2023.47 SICREDI UNIÃO RS/ES Check the complete list of projects covered by municipality.The Social Fund is a program in which cooperatives allocate a percentage of the results of the previous year to support local social projects of collective interest. The supported actions may include practices aimed at education, culture, sport, health, environment, safety and social inclusion. In this way, we materialize our interest in the community and manage to make a difference, supporting actions that generate long-term results, with benefits measurable. On the Sicredi na Comunidade platform, we have a Social Fund tool. In it, it is possible to register social projects of collective interest that can be supported by Sicredi and that contribute to the development of the communities where we operate. The Social Fund is part of the Cooperative's Strategic Planning and was created with the aim of supporting local projects of collective interest, where part of the Cooperative's result, that is, 2.5% of the previous year, is allocated to Social Fund (after payment of interest on capital and allocation of lost amounts recovered from previous years to the reserve fund), contributing to non-profit entities that make a difference in people's lives. In 2023, we began deliveries to entities covered by the Social Fund on August 18th. More than R$ 2 million were invested in the development of the local community.

Thus, students are the protagonists, acting as researchers, investigators and sharing knowledge with everyone. With the help of the Guiding Teacher, students create their own cooperatives for educational purposes. A Program that expands learning opportunities for children and adolescents, experiencing cooperative values ​​and principles. Participating in the Program are volunteer students from Elementary and High School, along with teachers, Sicredi cooperatives, Education Departments, among other partners. They have the challenge of creating their own educational cooperatives in groups with help and guidance. The result is learning in practice and the expansion of knowledge that permeates cooperation, group work and planning. The Program is organized into phases, and each phase has a purpose. Students develop cooperative skills, knowledge and values ​​while applying a learning path gamified cooperative.
