Board of Directors and Board of Directors The year 2021 was marked by recovery. Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. By means of the credit lines granted to members in cooperatives, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of the communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did the lines of the Public Power's emergency programs. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), making many of our demands viable since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that They can be used to answer questions and receive support via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, we returned to operating in person in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, the main administrative fact was the search for resources outside Brazil through decapitations. In the first of these, we signed an agreement with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to stimulate solar energy projects. In the cooperative, the Women's Committee and the Sustainability Committee were also created, with the objectives of promoting diversity and inclusion and strengthening its management model. Therefore, another international fundraising deserves to be highlighted. We seek resources for micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. The initiative includes gender as a criterion for using resources, as well as other factors social and environmental. To increase the benefits generated for members, we grant exemption from annual fees for all types of cards offered by the cooperative. This benefit was extended to all members, promoting a reduction in costs when using this payment method. On another front, the cooperative operated numerous social businesses throughout 2021, contributing to the development of the community where it operates. Through the AUnião FazaVida Program, the cooperative promoted training, online and in-person, for teachers in your area of ​​expertise, providing support for the new hybrid teaching scenario and the resumption of in-person classes. And, seeking to further promote financial education and cooperative education, Sicredi Ouro Verde MT launched a distance education platform, offering courses for members and non-members. Locally, we worked hard to ensure that member demands were met, especially those related to tackling the pandemic. and economic recovery. Among the actions, we highlight the “Cooperation to Save Lives” campaign, developed with the aim of benefiting health entities that worked directly in combating Covid-19. From there, we allocated resources to purchase hospital equipment in different municipalities, in addition to rapid tests, masks, gloves, alcohol gel and PPE for healthcare professionals and military police officers. Through the Social Fund, we also benefit projects from assistance entities in the municipalities from the cooperative's area of ​​activity and, as part of the national Cooperate Day (C Day) movement, we collect food for families experiencing food insecurity. Furthermore, we continued to operate the movements “People Who Cooperate Care” and “I Cooperate with the Local Economy”, which helped us take care of people and communities, reaffirming the strength of cooperation as an engine capable of contributing to the continuity of economic activity in the country. #Information classification: Internal UseACTIVE 5,970,827 4,591,053 LIABILITIES 5,016,839 3,794,753 CASH (Note 04) 20,876 22,703 DEPOSITS (Note 12) 2,646,513 2,133,911 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 5,886,358 4,576,997 Deposit s in cash 770,165 560,630 Interbank liquidity applications (Note 05) 32,489 14,243 Savings deposits 1,945 - Securities (Note 06) 566,963 731,728 Interbank deposits 140,326 86,012 Financial centralization (Note 04) 703,340 642,788 Term deposits 1,734,077 1,487,269 Interbank relations 348 471 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2,120,108 1,494,500 Credit operations (Note 07) 4,356,378 3,028,894 Interbank relations (Note 13) 2,083,894 1,456,318 Other financial assets (Note 08) 226,840 158,873 Loan obligations (Note 14) 21,383 21,122 PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES EXPECTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT RISK (Note 07) (157,973) (154,816) Obligations for transfers (Note 15) 396 883 OTHER ASSETS (Note 09) 12,669 21,587 Other financial liabilities (Note 16) 14,435 16,177 INVESTMENTS (Note 10) 136,528 76,858 PROVISIONS FOR CIVIL, TAX AND LABOR RISKS (Note 17) 2,306 1,503 FIXED ASSETS IN USE (Note 11) 64,287 39,183 OTHER LIABILITIES (Note 18) 247,912 164,839 INTANGIBLE (Note 11) 8,082 8,541 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (Note 19) 953,988 796,300 SHARE CAPITAL 366,717 312,701 SURPLUS RESERVES 510,864 422,956 SURPLUS OR ACCUMULATED LOSSES 76,407 60,643 TOTAL ASSETS 5,970,827 4,591,053 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 5,970,827 4,591,053 The explanatory notes are an integral part of the Financial StatementsBALANCE SHEET (In thousands of Reais) Ouro Verde do Mato Grosso Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative - Sicredi Ouro Verde MT CNPJ/MF no. 26.529.420/0001-53 ASSETS 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 LIABILITIES 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 #Classification of information: Internal use TICKETS AND REVENUES FROM FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION 306,920 503,808 422,604 Credit operations ( Note 07 ) 253,562 426,996 394,077 Income from securities 28,388 42,045 14,222 Operating rights income. financial assets - - 501 Inflows from intercooperative deposits 24,970 34,767 13,804 FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION EXPENSES AND EXPENSES (178,726) (232,817) (208,439) Market funding operations (Note 12) (54,092) (76,744) (32,920) Loan and onlending operations (83,466) (112,956) (117,023) Provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk (Note 07) (41,168) (43,117) (58,496) GROSS RESULT FROM FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION 128,194 270,991 214,165 OTHER TICKETS AND REVENUES/EXPENSES AND EXPENSES Operational (48,359) (76,302) (49,500) Service provision tickets and revenues (note 22) 42,312 87,538 74,337 Bank fees 9,320 18,056 16,676 expenditure and personnel expenses (note 23) (37,743) (71,517) (71,517) (59,081) Other administrative expenses and expenses (Note 24) (47,172) (92,832) (69,798) Tax expenses and expenses (181) (705) (1,922) Other operating income and income (Note 25) 14,045 37,718 47,073 Other expenses and expenses operational (Note 26) (28,940) (54,560) (56,785) OPERATING RESULT 79,835 194,689 164,665 RESULT BEFORE TAXATION ON PROFIT AND PARTICIPATION 79,835 194,689 164,665 INCOME TAX AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION (Note 2 0) 216 11 (2,973) Provision for Income Tax 131 11 (1,808) Provision for Social Contribution 85 - (1,165) SHARES IN LEFTOVERS (6,934) (11,649) (11,000) RESULTS OF THE YEAR BEFORE ALLOCATIONS 73,117 183,051 150,692 The notes explanatory statements are an integral part of the Financial Statements STATEMENTS OF SURPLUS OR LOSSES (In thousands of Reais) Ouro Verde do Mato Grosso Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative - Sicredi Ouro Verde MT CNPJ/MF nº 26.529.420/0001-53 Description of accounts01/07 /2021 to 12/31/2021 (Unaudited)01/01/2021 to 12/31/202101/01/2020 to 12/31/2020 (Represented) #Classification of information: Internal use TICKETS AND REVENUES FROM FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION OTHER TICKETS AND OPERATING REVENUES/EXPENDITS AND EXPENSES CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NET INCREASE/DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT Cash and cash equivalent at the beginning of the period Cash and cash equivalent at the end of the period (Note 04) Availability Financial centralization Total Execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules.

Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, this was carried out reclassification of deposit receipts intercooperatives, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centers via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other income and operating income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank in the market, generating revenue of financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20, there was a change in the way in which statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses of non-operational income is no longer part of integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications related to changes were identified in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify them as cash and cash equivalent in accordance with the premises of CPC 03.
