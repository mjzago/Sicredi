Credit, Savings and Investment Cooperative Ouro Verde do Mato Grosso - Sicredi Ouro Verde MT Source: Accounting and Tax Management - Confederation Sicredi Accounting and Tax ManagementExecutive Directorate of Administration Superintendence of ControllershipFinancial Statements 2022 #Classification of information: Internal UseReinforcing your commitment to the region of 15 municipalities in Mato Where it operates, Sicredi Ouro Verde MT opened, in 2022, its new Administrative Headquarters, a more comfortable and modern, with architecture based on the pillars of sustainability. Also aiming to expand business and provide a better relationship experience for members, the cooperative opened two new branches in Cuiabá - Agência Coxipó and Agência Pedra 90, the latter located in a large region that did not yet have financial institution services. Through the Save, Invest and Earn and Capitalize and Earn campaigns, the cooperative also promoted its investment and capital products social, providing benefits to members and savers. We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving individuals, companies and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. Thus, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting from the foundation of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate is one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fedfunds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% -4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the cycle high interest rates with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should continue at this high level until half of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good growth of GDP in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. Sepor On the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in default and family debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the of prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the next years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society #Information classification: Internal UseWe value people and diversity Our commitment to development and positive impact in the regions where we operate have been premises since our foundation. Below we list some initiatives carried out in 2022: With the AUnião FazaVida Program, Sicredi's main social responsibility program, the cooperative reached new schools in Cuiabá, expanding the reach of the initiative to 71 thousand students in the 15 municipalities in the area of ​​operation. Through the Social Fund, the cooperative contributed to the development of 105 projects by charitable entities, and also supported the maintenance of the Cancer Hospital in Cuiabá and the construction of the Love Hospital, in Sinop. Innovating in its role as a promoter of economic and social development, the cooperative held the 1st Hackaton Social Development, which sought solutions for the employability of young people in the region. Several Financial Education and Crescer actions also provided information and training to members and the community in general, and through DiaC, the cooperative's employees became volunteers for actions that led to transformations in their regions. With the School Cooperatives program, three new cooperatives were founded in Lucas do Rio Verde, encouraging student leadership and entrepreneurship. In 2022, the cooperative also began implementing the Youth Committee, and developed training and engagement actions with the Women's Committee. We seek to promote diversity and train new leaders for cooperatives, and our committees bring strength to these initiatives in all regions where we operate.

The effect the change in the CSLL rate of the rate differential for Cooperatives, in which the Social Contribution rate went from 15% to 20% as of July 2021 and returned to 15% as of January 2022.

VIII - Socio-environmental RiskVI - Liquidity Risk Understanding Liquidity Risk is essential for the sustainability of institutions that operate in the financial and capital markets and is associated with the institution's ability to finance commitments acquired at reasonable market prices and carry out its business plans with stable sources of financing. For this purpose, it is defined liquidity risk such as: •The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the commitment of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring significant losses; and •The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate the market price of a position, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market. Management The liquidity risk of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's entities in managing liquidity risk.

The IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing of the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing IRRBB risk. To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation result (NII) approaches are used. The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for managing IRRBB risk in the Sicredi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the institutions’ IRRBB risk exposure of the System.

Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. #Information classification: Internal UseInformation security risk is defined as risk related to probability exploiting a vulnerability, considering the linked threats, and the impact on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information and the controls implemented. Cybersecurity or cybersecurity risks are part of the context of information security risks. At Sicredi, information security risk management is carried out jointly with Banks, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives, which are responsible for complying with internal regulations and external, relying on tools and systemic methodologies that can be complemented by local actions. Processes and actions aimed at information security aim to maintain risks at acceptable levels, including the use of adequate and effective controls, taking into account costs, technology and business objectives. Processes for managing compliance risk include: • Identification of compliance risks of the institution; • Communication, qualification and training from all levels of the Entity to adequately manage compliance risks and comply with legal and (self)regulatory requirements; • Monitoring and monitoring of relevant processes, actions taken to mitigate compliance risks and correct deficiencies, with the aim of promoting compliance. • Report of relevant adjustments and new measures to mitigate risks, as well as identified non-conformities; • Identification of actions and/or processes associated with the main risks, which need to be reviewed, updated or implemented, seeking the effectiveness of the Compliance Program as a whole; • Treatment of identified non-compliances as well as development of awareness-raising actions, seeking to prevent recurrence.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to prepare a implementation plan. Said plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the plan for implementation of said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (Gap analysis); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan. Capital Margin consists of the institution's excess capital over the minimum regulatory requirements and the additional principal capital.
