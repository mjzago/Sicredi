After After so many decades of incessant work, we continue to grow and prepare for the future, based on the cooperative ideals of our founders and generating value for members and their communities. With a sense of historical continuity, this report is an assessment of our trajectory and the main actions carried out in 2022. Aiming to always strengthen the principles of cooperativism, the year was marked by important changes in the management of the System, focused on our governance, continuing the excellent work of the teams and providing the best experience for our associates. Since March 2022, we have adopted the model of exclusive presidency of the Board of Directors. Still within the scope of the Council, we elected the Independent Director, Andiara Petterle, the first woman to occupy this position, reinforcing our commitment to expanding diversity in senior leadership positions. We also continue with the senior leadership succession plan, electing a new CEO of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi and Confederação Sicredi. From a regulatory point of view, we maintained our strong commitment to integrity and solidity throughout our operations. Seeking to always be ahead of the best governance and management practices and aligned with regulatory movements in the financial sector, we updated the following internal policies: the Sustainability Policy and the Social, Environmental and Climate Risk Policy. We end the year with a important milestone in our history: we registered the arrival of more than 1 million new members, who believe in our purpose and business model. This achievement is the result of all the work carried out by our Cooperatives, Centrals and Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). We have consolidated ourselves as the second largest agribusiness financing institution, allocating R$53.8 billion in financing for the sector. We thus reinforce our commitment to the development of one of the economic activities of greatest relevance to the country's growth and development. At the same time, we continue to support Brazilian Small and Medium-sized Companies (SMEs), which contribute so much to the economy and the generation of jobs and income in the country. Through Pronampe, we allocated R$2.8 billion in financing for the sector, providing security for SMEs to undertake. We also continue to work towards the digital evolution of our business, in line with changes in company behavior. society, trends in the global economy and mainly the needs of our associates, adopting an approach that solidifies our relationship strategy for the future. We have significantly advanced our digital association journey, with the aim of bringing cooperativism to more people and delivering a simple and close experience to our members, in a way connected to local strategies. We highlight the launch of the Sicredi marketplace, developed to expand presence in the life cycle and consumption of members, while strengthening the local economy. We also began offering direct access to the capital markets with the launch of our variable income operation. Through it, members can trade shares, real estate funds, ETFs and BDRs on the spot market through Home Broker Sicredi, in addition to receiving digital service via WhatsApp. Just as we continually invest in expanding and qualifying the portfolio of digital solutions, we continue to expand the physical service network. With our arrival in the state of Roraima, in April, we provided the opportunity to disseminate the concepts of cooperativism to a new region and began to operate in all federative units in Brazil. We currently have more than 2,400 branches in the country, with more than 270 being opened in 2022, representing an increase of 11.4% in our structure. In more than 200 cities, we are the only financial institution physically present, bringing financial inclusion to the region's population. We also started building our public sustainability commitments, reinforcing our maturity and commitment to sustainable development. 4 5 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022INTRODUCTIONCésar Bochi Chief Executive Officer of Banco Cooperativo SicrediFernando Dall’Agnese Chairman of the Board of Directors of SicrediPar In this sense, we are members of the Pact Global and we are committed to contributing to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, which support our sustainability strategy. In 2022, we underwent an assessment by Morningstar Sustainalytics, which classified Sicredi as having “Low Risk” in ESG themes, which positions us as a cooperative financial institution among the top 20 in the ranking of Diversified Banks in the world, in environmental aspects, social and governance. Still focusing on sustainability, we were pioneers in launching the first Sustainable Financial Bill (LFS) in the Brazilian market, raising R$780 million in resources converted into credit for projects aligned with sustainability. In the investment sector, our Asset considers sustainability transversally in its strategy and management, offering members investment options aligned with ESG criteria. Through our initiatives and programs, we bring a positive impact to the communities where we operate. Throughout the year, more than half a million children and adolescents participated in the A União Faz a Vida Program, based on its own teaching methodology, which values ​​the knowledge obtained inside and outside of school. With the purpose of “cooperating for a sustainable financial life”, our Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis was nominated and elected by popular vote as the best Education Initiative Finance in the 2022 Banking Transformation Award, ranking carried out by Cantarino Brasileiro. With our eyes on our internal teams, we are proud to provide a healthy environment for more than 38 thousand employees throughout Brazil. We were certified as an excellent place to work, having stood out among the best companies to work for in the “Financial Institutions – Credit Unions” category according to Great Place to Work (GPTW). In line with the main debates in society, we created the Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Committees, aiming to strengthen plurality throughout the System, in addition to directing our initiatives. We reached 120 years with pride in our trajectory and with an eye towards the future. In 2022, we began the construction of the new Strategic Cycle, which will guide our operations until 2025. This construction, carried out with systemic participation, aims to define strategies for generating value, with ESG at the heart of the business, strengthening our cooperative essence. We end the year inspired to continue generating a positive impact on society. We feel challenged and excited to continue bringing credit unions to more people, promoting new local economies and generating socio-environmental development for communities. 6 7 2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT INTRODUCTION Welcome to Sicredi’s 2022 Sustainability Report. Throughout this document, we present how we generate value through the cooperative business model, considering the ESG (environmental, social and governance) aspects that are part of our Sustainability Strategy. The information reported includes all singular, central and companies based in the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). In preparing this document, we followed the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, a voluntary standard adopted by companies from the most diverse sectors and countries for sustainability reporting. For the first year, we reported the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standard for the financial sector, demonstrating our commitment to transparency with our stakeholders, in addition to market standardization. The scope of the report and the indicators reported were based on our materiality, defined by three sustainability drivers and their twelve focal themes (find out more on page 46).

GRI 2-1 We are physically present in all Brazilian states and the Federal District, with more than 2,400 branches, and we offer more than 300 financial and non-financial products and services. GRI 2-1 We have a systemic operating model, in which each of our more than 100 cooperatives has the autonomy to operate locally, and has the support of the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS) in technology, security and financial solidity. Cooperatives are responsible for implementing systemic strategies taking into account local needs. Each cooperative is affiliated with one of the five regional centers, which are shareholders of the SicrediPar Board of Directors, a holding company that coordinates, together with the cooperatives themselves, the System's strategic decisions. We also have, in our structure, specialized companies that offer security and reliability to members, such as Confederação Sicredi, Sicredi Fundo Guarantors, Fundação Sicredi, Banco Cooperativo Sicredi and its controlled companies — the Asset Administrator, the Consortium Administrator and the Insurance Broker —, located in Porto Alegre (RS), at the Sicredi Administrative Center.

It has been a long and prosperous journey, which is closely connected with the principles of cooperativism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. It was in 1902 that Father Theodor Amstad and leaders from the community of Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul, formed Caixa de Economia e Empréstimos Amstad, currently Sicredi Pioneira, marking the beginning of credit cooperatives in Brazil. Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland , in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and Holland, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 people from the community, with whom he worked to put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. Together, they started a cooperative enterprise that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first central one, bringing together several cooperatives, even in the first decades of the 20th century. The model was taken forward, overcoming the challenges that arose in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside he arrived in the cities, maintaining, over the decades, the objective of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for associates, in the search for a better quality of life for all. “Reaching the brand The 120 years of credit cooperativism in Brazil fills us with pride, as it shows that we are consistently continuing the path that was paved by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen about 160 years ago, across the ocean, and followed in Brazil by Father Amstad.” Fernando Dall’Agnese, President of the Board of Directors of Sicredi (SicrediPar). “Our principles and values ​​are based on cooperation between people, focusing on the development of regions through the promotion of a virtuous cycle, in which resources continue to circulate in the cooperative’s area of ​​activity.” César Bochi, President Director of the Bank Sicredi Cooperative.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advance of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. Faced with the difficulty they faced in purchasing food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers met and founded the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the members contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. Rochdale's pioneers marked the history of cooperatives by understanding that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved. 14 15 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022O SICREDI1. Free and voluntary membership Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to everyone able to use its services and willing to accept the responsibilities as members, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination. 2. Democratic management Cooperatives are democratic organizations, controlled by their members, who actively participate in the formulation of their policies and decision-making. Men and women, elected as representatives of the other members, are responsible to them. In first-degree cooperatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote); higher grade cooperatives are also organized democratically.3. Economic participation of members Contributions are made equally to the capital of the cooperatives and control is carried out democratically. Part of this capital is normally common property of the cooperative (called the Reserve Fund). Members can receive, if there are economic and financial conditions to do so, a remuneration on paid-in capital, called interest on share capital. Surpluses are destined for one or more of the following purposes: development of the cooperative, enabling the formation of reserves, partly indivisible; return to members in proportion to their transactions with cooperatives and support for other activities that are approved by members. VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF COOPERATIVISM When exercising our active role as members, acting as owners of the business, we make everyone's financial life more cooperative and prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and becomes the supply of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities.4. Autonomy and independence Cooperatives are autonomous mutual aid organizations. Even when they enter in an operational agreement with other entities, including government entities, they must do so under terms that preserve their democratic control by their partners and maintain their autonomy.5. Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the Cooperatives Program Schoolchildren, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer and Cooperation Program in Ponta do Lápis, which develop cooperative citizens engaged in the development of their community. 6. Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicredi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to its members and society. 7. Interest by the community Credit cooperatives may be located in regions with low levels of economic and social development, where traditional financial institutions do not see the possibility of profit. The vision of the cooperative institution is not profit, but development. In this way, each product or financial service that members purchase from the cooperative brings a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth for the region. principles of cooperativism in practice The seven principles of cooperativism, which were born with the Rochdale Pioneers and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era. Its last update was carried out by the International Cooperative Alliance (ACI) in 1995. The principles of cooperativism direct and support us in generating positive impact: 16 17 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022O SICREDIExpansion • In In 2022, we continued our expansion process with the opening of another 270 branches, demonstrating accelerated growth in the post-pandemic economic recovery scenario. • We gained more than 1.2 million new members, 15% more compared to the previous year.

This internal rule takes into account the size of the entities and the composition of their assets. GRI 2-19 To determine the remuneration of leaders, we annually carry out a nationwide salary survey, together with an external consultancy, to maintain the competitiveness in the management of people in entities. GRI 2-20 Compensation consultants participate in the process by constructing salary reference tables considering the matching of positions with the salary survey. After these contributions, executive remunerations are approved at the General Meeting. GRI 2-20 We have a People Committee that monitors and participates in this decision-making for executives and other levels. As for Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, we have with a Remuneration Committee that monitors the strategic remuneration process. GRI 2-20 In addition to the fixed remuneration, there is an annual short-term variable portion, linked to the business performance in the period, and a long-term variable portion, aimed at retaining statutory employees, business sustainability, career transition and the succession. The definition of targets and indicators for these variables is carried out by entity and, currently, no entity uses target socio-environmental. GRI 2-19 Councilors of centrals and cooperatives receive attendance cards or a monthly fee approved at the General Assembly of members, also taking into account the size of each entity. Similar rules are used for companies based in Centro Administrativo Sicredi (CAS), approved by the General Assembly, observing the specific legislation of each company. GRI 2-19 The variable remuneration model for executives is based on the calculation of multiples salaries defined by positions, short and long term, the latter in the Long Term Retention model (in a membership format per entity). We rely on the clawback rule for the variable remuneration model for CAS executives, which provides for a reduction in the amount to be paid in case specific requirements of the model are not met. GRI 2-19 We currently offer the Private Pension Plan for all employees and statutory employees. In this plan, the contribution can vary from 1% (one percent) to 10% (ten percent) of the monthly remuneration, according to the ceiling established by the entity. The amount is deducted from the payroll or monthly fees. In the same percentage chosen by the employee/statutory employee, there is a counterpart from the company.

To carry out this work, we are counting on the support of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which is a leading global consultancy in strategy. BCG also has a governance and decision-making model that is similar to ours, where partners are part of the board and participate in decisions. The construction of the cycle is estimated to last six months, officially starting in January and expected to be completed at the end of the first half of 2023. The process will have three major stages: • Context and competitive advantages: in which we will address our inspirational vision, internal and external vision; • Strategic options: how the core levers of the business and surrounding areas and possible new businesses will be analyzed and chosen; • Planning the execution: where the execution plan and economic plan will be constructed, considering the choices made throughout the semester.

As a way of leveraging discussions on the topic, we work on the Action Platforms of the Global Compact Brazil Network on the following fronts: • Action Platform for Human Rights; • Action Platform for Sustainable Agro; • Action Platform against Corruption; • Climate Action Platform. By joining the Global Compact we are also committed to contributing to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, outlined by the UN to engage organizations in goals such as eradicating poverty, combating climate change and preserving natural resources by 2030. Find out more about the priority SDGs, on page 47. PARTICIPATION IN COP 27 We participated in the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27), promoted by the United Nations (UN), the world's main climate meeting, which brings together leaders from almost all countries. The event took place in the resort of Sharm El-Sheihk, in Egypt, between the 8th and 18th of November 2022. The manager of Structured Operations and Sustainable Finance, João Pedro Stephanou, represented Sicredi at this year's edition. The opportunity to present a case at the world conference came at the invitation of Sebrae MT, which maintains a partnership with Central Sicredi Centro Norte. During the event, João Pedro presented the Green Energy Program panel – Opportunity for Small Businesses, where topics of cooperative model, governance model, sustainability strategy, ESG funding and good practices in clean energy were addressed, with emphasis on financing photovoltaic solar energy. The economic benefits of credit unions and our entire sustainability movement were also presented. 50 51 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Reference Sustainable Development To direct our Sustainability Strategy and support us in the evolution of sustainability guidelines, we rely on the Sustainable Development Framework. This is a basis for Sicredi's Positive Impact Measurement, providing indicators that allow us to measure our sustainability performance at national, regional and local levels. The material is the result of a great deal of collaborative work that took place throughout 2021. The process it included discussions with representatives from the entire System, to define the indicators that would compose it, in addition to an evaluation by the College of Executive Directors and recommendation by the Foundation Committee and deliberation by SicrediPar's Board of Directors. Since its implementation for cooperatives, in 2022, the Reference has been used as an internal tool to measure the sustainability performance of System entities. In view of this, the analysis of the results is considered a minimum agenda for all of the System's sustainability committees, as it supports the identification of opportunities to advance the sustainability agenda, supporting the construction of action plans. Based on the set of indicators presented in the Benchmark, we provide cooperatives with an online tool (dashboard) that presents their performance data, based on the Benchmark's Executive Vision. Through it, it is possible to generate reports to monitor the entity's performance over time and its stage of maturity. SICREDI'S SYSTEMIC COMMITMENTS In 2022, we began the process of building our Public Sustainability Commitments. In this first moment, we carried out a sector analysis and Sustainability references, bringing important elements to the discussion for decision-making. We build a map that identifies opportunities for themes to outline objectives, initiatives and metrics. In 2023, we will continue the collective construction of our systemic objectives and goals.Business sustainability indicators EXECUTIVE SUSTAINMENT INDICATORS 2021 2022 Active account holders (percentage) 72.46% 75.17% NPS (percentage) 74.8% 74, 4% General principality (percentage) 33.87% 39.40% Market share of deposits in the coverage area (percentage) 3.4% 3.8% Total net worth (billions) 24.9 30.3 Adjusted efficiency ratio to the risk 0.65 0.69 Positive impact indicators RELATIONSHIPS AND COOPERATIVISM 2020 2021 2022 PILLAR PAGE Associates (quantity) 4,901,724 5,579,161 6,488,112 Social 26 Cooperatives (quantity) 108 108 105 Social 13 Employees (quantity) 29 .830 34.127 38.816 Social 150 Associates who participated in assemblies (thousands)286 299 440 Social 61 Associates who participated in assemblies (percentage)9.4% 5.7% 7.4% Social 61 Core coordinators (quantity)11,238 12,908 13,107 Social 63 Associates participating in the Crescer Program (quantity) 48,161 70,010 120,894 Governance 77 Core coordinators trained in basic training – 39.7% 60% Governance 78 Advisors trained in basic training – 58.4% 65.7% Governance 78 Entities with Committees of Sustainability– 52 77 Governance 44 Women in leadership positions – total Elected (core coordinators, counselors and presidents) + statutory + CLT– 30.77% 31.67% Governance 84 Young people in leadership positions leadership – total Elected (core coordinators, counselors and presidents) + statutory + CLT – 22.41% 21.65% Governance 84 52 53 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGYRESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS Sicredi SR 03 | SR 06 2020 2021 2022VALUE GENERATEDPAGE Amount invested in the Green Economy (R$ billion) 18.9 27.6 34.2 Economic 119 Employees trained in topics related to economic, environmental and climate risks 3– 29,037 36,923 Governance 130 Female agriculture (R$ million) 18.24 17.54 18.08 Economic 120 Low Carbon Agriculture (R$ million) 4,061 6,666 8,285 Economic 120 Good agricultural practices (R$ million) 1,525 2,249 2,421 Economic 120 Renewable Energy and Environmental Sustainability (R$ million)2,356 4,531 6,136 Economic 120 Solar energy operations (R$ billion)1.6 3.3 3.5 Economic 119 Absolute greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) ¹21,358.98 20,636.07 28,368, 55 Environmental 137 Total emissions per employee (tCO2e/employee)0.7 0.6 0.7 Environmental 137 National Week of Financial Education Actions Impacted people (millions) 4.4 19 20 Social 90 1 The results presented in the table consider the total emissions following the approach of choosing to purchase energy in Scope 2. 2 The data considers the result distributed in meetings added to the payment of interest on equity, the value of which is presented in the subsequent line.

In terms of growth, Brazilian economic performance was slightly more favorable than official forecasts. In the first and second quarters of 2022, the growth observed in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed a positive performance of 1.7% and 3.2%, respectively, so that the initial projection of GDP growth for the year had to be recalculated. The initial estimate of 1.8% was positively revised, with growth prospects between 2.5% and 2.8%, an estimate endorsed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. In relation to inflation, which remained on an upward trajectory, as a result of the economic contraction resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, the observed rates showed a decrease compared to 2021, with values ​​of IPCA accumulated at 5.77% in the last 12 months. The Selic rate remained high, recording 13.75% p.a. in 2022, the highest value recorded since 2016, which solidifies a perspective of restrictive credit growth. The impacts of the increase in the Selic rate are multisectoral and should represent the keynote of the performance of the Brazilian economy for the year 2023. In this context, the country accumulated more than 69.4 million defaulters, compared to just over 62 million in 2021 . Of Of the total number of defaulters identified in the year, 28.7% have a restricted name due to their inability to pay credit card debts. In response, we worked more intensely on topics that deal with pricing and credit recovery during the year. To this end, we carry out initiatives aimed at billing and financial education to support our members at this sensitive time. We are thus able to guarantee our financial returns while at the same time we generate value for communities.

GRI 3-3 Through the Program, we establish the rules and guidelines that guide your participation experience. For cooperatives, we provide instruments to expand the activities of members at assemblies. We therefore seek to bring more transparency to our actions and strengthen engagement. GRI 3-3 In addition to face-to-face meetings, which allow contact and relationship with our associates, we have the Digital Assembly Platform. Through it, we promote the democratic participation of members with all the convenience of the digital model, reducing travel and facilitating access, in addition to promoting accessibility for those who may have limitations in participating in person. The platform makes it possible to hold digital or blended events, with live or recorded broadcasts, and voting in the matters of deliberation. Members can clarify their doubts and register their considerations and comments through a chat channel. The tool was made available in 2021 at a time of pandemic, with restrictions on holding in-person events and, during this period, it became essential for members to could remain close to their cooperatives, exercising their role as owner safely and responsibly. Today, the platform is yet another instrument we have at our disposal. willingness to encourage ever greater participation from our associates. In total, around 440,000 members attended the 2022 meetings, which represents 7.44% of those called. Member participationStrengthening our governance model Our members are at the center of our business. Therefore, the assembly is the supreme body of the cooperative society, essential to our governance model. It is the maximum moment of democratic decision-making, where Associates exercise their role as owner, monitoring and deciding the direction of their cooperative. The assemblies are spaces for empowering associates, where each one is a protagonist in building the future of the business, transforming the reality and living conditions of communities. In the System, each entity has an important role in the assemblies. Cooperatives are responsible for conducting the decision-making process with their members, providing information and adequate access to events. The centers support the cooperatives in this process. Fundação Sicredi has the role of structuring and providing solutions that facilitate this process and allow the participation of more and more members, with quality and transparency.

Furthermore, the Platform brings new functionalities, a dynamic experience for the user, integration with the course platform and aims to bring entities even closer to their leaders. With the aim of providing participation in the management and development process of the cooperative, Associates are grouped by nuclei and organized by the Pertencer Program. Core assemblies are important meetings to strengthen the relationship and transparency of our business, as they are where debates and decisions on matters of collective interest to the cooperative take place. At their assemblies, all associates can monitor the accountability, evaluate the actions and initiatives developed, contribute with suggestions, clarify doubts and address other issues. In 2022, we surpassed 5,400 active cores. It is also in the nucleus that, together, the associates elect their representative, called the core coordinator. Each coordinator is responsible for taking the decisions of their core members to the cooperative's General Assembly. At the end of 2022, we had 13,107 core coordinators, including permanent and substitute staff.

With this, we implemented new technologies in corporate equipment, in branch network security, in channel and application security tests. A broad security awareness program was implemented, in addition to improving processes and security standards in development, to promote risk reduction. Sicredi RC13 In actions preventive measures to combat fraud, we have increased new technologies that aim to expand our capacity to identify fraud and we have improved the processes for bringing in new members, mitigating the risk of ideological falsehood. In 2022, our Electronic Transaction Security indicator achieved a result of 99.9957% protection across channels, contributing to risk mitigation and a better experience for associates. Sicredi RC13 In physical security, with the evolution in branch controls and centralized monitoring of images and alarms that resulted in greater security for our associates and employees, we achieved an 82% rate in preserving the values ​​of agencies that suffered criminal attacks. Sicredi RC13Cybersecurity In order to provide greater security to members during their electronic transactions and safeguard their data, we have internal technologies and processes that prioritize cybersecurity in our services and products. In this sense, we manage information and cyber security risk through a specialized model that considers threats, potentially used attack surfaces, the probability of occurrence and the possible impacts on the business in the event of a risk materializing. The model also considers the preventive, detective and corrective controls we use to mitigate threats. SASB FN-CB-230a. 2 The controls and the control model Risk management is based on cybersecurity frameworks and best practices, including NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), CIS (Center for Internet Security), ISO 27001, SANS (Incident Handler's Handbook) and MITER ATT&CK, complying with legislation , regulations and self-regulations to which we are exposed. SASB FN-CB- 230a. 2 In the event of an information security incident, we have a formalized process that includes identification, containment, response and investigation of the event, as well as the subsequent recording of information to address weaknesses and lessons learned. SASB FN-CB-230 a.2 We also have automated preventive controls to identify possible vulnerabilities in information systems, with established processes that include the identification, categorization, classification and treatment of identified vulnerabilities. SASB FN-CB-23 0a.2 Data protection We have developed a broad Data Protection and Privacy Program, applying since 2019 the concepts and provisions of the General Law for the Protection and Privacy of Personal Data (LGPD) and other related legislation in its business processes. Respect for the privacy of data subjects who interact with Sicredi (whether members or non-members) is a fundamental precept within the organization's banking and service activities. To support this program, we have a structure distributed – with the coordination of actions being carried out by the Data Protection and Privacy management, located at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, and with those responsible (data managers and their respective assistants) in each entity of the System (single cooperatives, central and centralizing entities) for the adjustments of their activities. In the formal regulatory structure focused on data privacy, we have internal and external policies, which stipulate the main processes, roles and responsibilities regarding the discipline. The data protection and privacy program has four basic pillars to support it. • Legal pillar: which evaluates all contractual relationships we have with other parties – whether they are associates, non-associates, suppliers, partners, third parties and other stakeholders with necessary legal binding. It is important to mention here that the contractual legal business relationship was not and will not be amended – due to the existence of a legal basis with associates that authorizes the legitimate interest or execution of contracts to complete the perfect legal relationship between these parties. • Information technology pillar: which evaluates the structural part of the IT infrastructure (and, consequently, information technology) to validate security adequacy compatible with regulatory requirements. Find out more at: https://www.sicredi. com.br/ site/protecao-e-privacidade/ 72 73 2022 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STRENGTHEN OUR GOVERNANCE MODEL• Process pillar: which evaluates in particular the processing of personal data carried out in each Sicredi product and service (at any level, be it CAS – considering systemic, central and cooperative processes) and classifies them into Data Processing Operations (OTDs), which perform the regulatory role of recording data processing. • Training and awareness pillar: which works on all actions necessary to change culture regarding the use of personal data. This pillar is considered to be of fundamental importance: even implementing all the necessary procedures of the other pillars (considered technical), if the behavior of the people executing the process in relation to data processing is not modified and adequate in accordance with the attributes of the law, events of non-observance of data privacy practices will continue to exist. During 2022, 9,017 requests from data subjects were met – a procedure provided for by the LGPD, where data subjects can ask data controllers how their information is being treated, with whom it is shared, corrections of information, mandatory deletion or anonymization of data and other information provided for in the legislation. There is no specific legal deadline for responding to these requests provided for by law, but the current understanding assumes that these responses must be carried out within 15 days. The average of our Service Level Agreement (SLA) was 3.94 days. All answers are based on data processing information maintained by the data protection and privacy program, which currently has 600 data processing operations duly documented and catalogued. Operations with third parties participating in Sicredi's data processing chain were also documented, with a management process over these suppliers in order to guarantee the same respect for the privacy of data holders as assured in internal processes. We understand that the management of all information under the supervision of Sicredi is fundamental to the guarantee, effectiveness and consolidation of the Program. No data breach incidents were recorded during 2022, with 25 minor events recorded and duly handled by the Management Process of Sicredi Data Privacy Incidents. Given the low severity of these events and the absence of damage to data subjects, there was no need to communicate to the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) or data subjects in any of the cases. Institutional Visits Program We have an Institutional Visits Program to the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS). Visits are a unique opportunity to interact with our audiences and provide a immersion experience in cooperativism. Visitors are welcomed into the physical space of Fundação Sicredi and discover the Sicredi Memorial, a complete structure dedicated to presenting the history of credit cooperatives and the positive impact of our business model. During visits, with the support of interactive technologies, we present content that covers our history, purpose, Sustainability Strategy and our portfolio of non-financial solutions. Aiming To further enrich this space and the experience of the countless visitors we receive, we installed in 2022, the year in which we completed 120 years of history, the Sicredi Gallery, in which we present some of the main awards and recognitions we have received throughout our history.BIBLIOTECA DO SICREDI Installed in the Fundação Sicredi space, at CAS, our Library has systemic reach, serving members and collaborators of all cooperatives that have the pouches system, with a specific collection on cooperativism and its activities in various sectors. It also has a special session focused on credit cooperatives, to preserve and disseminate the history of credit cooperatives in Brazil and around the world. With the Sicredi Library, we promote cooperative literature and encourage reading as a means of valuing and developing people.

Furthermore, it aims to contribute to strengthening citizenship and the efficiency and solidity of the National Financial System, supporting conscious decision-making by consumers. GRI FS16 We have participated in ENEF Week since 2016, being recognized, year after year, for the number of initiatives and audience reached. Among the initiatives carried out, both in person and in virtual format, we have lectures, workshops, courses, campaigns and posts on social networks, aimed at employees, associates and communities. Financial Education Journey in Schools Since 2018, financial education is one of the transversal themes that must be developed in all teaching stages of national education. As a result, in 2020 the topic became mandatory in schools, complying with the National Common Curricular Base (BNCC). With the aim of helping students achieve a sustainable financial life, in 2021 we launched the Journey of Financial Education in Schools, an initiative of the Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program aimed at teacher training. Thus, it aims to connect the theme with the school curriculum, considering the different Brazilian contexts in a inclusive and integral. The Journey is a complete training for teachers, which encourages their autonomy to work in the classroom, bringing an active and interdisciplinary pedagogical proposal that connects with the context and reality of each school community. The initiative includes the distribution of various authorial pedagogical materials, developed by experts and has pedagogical advisors who are partners of the cooperatives. These professionals are qualified by Sicredi to, together with the cooperative development teams, implement the Journey in schools and provide pedagogical support to educators throughout their training. By the end of 2022, we qualified 30 pedagogical advisors to develop the Financial Education Journey in Schools, which was carried out by 31 cooperatives. During this period, the Journey reached 125 municipalities and 331 schools in different regions of Brazil. We trained 2,308 teachers who are equipped to build pedagogical strategies focusing on financial education. The teachers carried out their pedagogical strategies with 35,128 students from the 1st to the 5th year of Elementary School, from public, private, rural and quilombola schools.

EVENTS ON FINANCIAL EDUCATION Participation in the Latin American Education Congress and Financial Inclusion (CLEIF) On September 27th and 28th, 2022, the Latin American Congress on Education and Financial Inclusion (CLEIF) was held, broadcast online. The Congress brought together renowned speakers and specialized audiences to identify and define best practices and uses for promoting and accessing financial services. The Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), with the support of the Central Bank of Brazil, was part of the “Financial Health Summit”, which is organized by Felaban (Latin American Federation of Banks) and brings together 18 countries on the continent and more than 600 banks and financial institutions in the region. Sicredi was the only cooperative financial institution that participated in one of the event's panels, on “The importance of measuring Financial Health for Financial Institutions”. Relationship with associates The close relationship with associates is part of our essence, after all, in cooperativism they are the owners of the business. Per We seek to understand your needs, offering financial solutions that add income and contribute to improving quality of life, promoting the local economy and financial inclusion. GRI 3-3 Therefore, our Relationship Policy with Associates, customers and users of Sicredi's Financial Products and Services establishes that the relationship must be based on the principles of cooperativism, our values ​​and regulatory and ethical determinations. In addition Furthermore, the document reinforces the need to provide information in a clear and precise manner and to respond to demands in a timely manner. GRI FS15 In the first half of the year, we updated the Policy and, throughout 2022, we carried out controls and implemented processes with the aim of acting more deeply on financial inclusion. We also seek to make our relationship with associates more transparent and communication simpler. GRI 3-3 In Policy management, We work with greater attention to the needs of members who make up our most vulnerable audiences, understood as those who may encounter difficulties in using our services. Some examples are people with disabilities, the elderly and people who live in more vulnerable communities and with little access to information. GRI FS15 To achieve this, we developed a matrix to map the member base and identify potentially vulnerable audiences by products and services and the their different degrees of vulnerability.OFFER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS WITH POSITIVE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Offer financial and non-financial solutions with positive economic, social and environmental impact 96 97 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTE FINANCIAL EDUCATIONAssociate satisfaction To monitor employee satisfaction associates, we carried out several surveys with this audience. The main metric used by the organization to measure the relationship experience with the brand is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). For more than a decade, we have carried out the NPS survey to monitor the satisfaction of our members. The interviews are carried out over the phone and the NPS is generated based on the answers to the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Sicredi to a friend or colleague?” NPS allows us to identify how satisfactory the relationship experience with our brand is to the point of our associates become promoters of it. Promoters are members who stay with us longer, consume more products, support the prospecting of new members and have a greater chance of becoming loyal. The NPS metric was developed by consultants from the company Bain & Company and is used by several companies. One of the main advances made in 2022 was the update of the Accredited Agent channel, an initiative that aims to serve, through partners, the communities where we do not have physical branches. One of the improvements made during the year was withdrawals via Pix, allowing anyone, member or not, to make withdrawals from accredited agents through Pix transfers, facilitating access to money. Also for this channel, the payment of taxes in the state of Santa Catarina was released, increasing the channel's portfolio and access to more financial services. GRI FS14  With regard to structures and processes, we streamline the association's process by removing the mandatory physical presentation of proof of residence, and we included a self-declaration term about residence in the contract. At the same time, we implemented digital technologies that allow us to eliminate the need to print paper for a series of processes, such as onboarding contracts, membership and changes to baskets and rates. GRI FS1 4 From January to December 2022 we carried out over 173 thousand surveys with associates in the personal segments physical, agribusiness and legal entities and the majority are brand promoters, which resulted in an NPS of 74.36%. More than 70% of promoters highlighted in the survey their satisfaction with the service provided at the agencies. Most mentions of service highlight the main strengths of employees being perceived as helpful, attentive and available to resolve our members' queries and requests. Relationship channels To strengthen our relationship with associates, we establish physical and digital channels in order to meet their particular needs and preferences. In this sense, we developed relationship channels connected to the evolution of our systems, mainly to the new platform that processes our financial solutions. GRI 3-3 We seek, therefore, to expand integration between all available channels, whether physical or digital, at the same time as we expand the offer of products and services and added new features, such as mobility and omnichannel. Digital channels Throughout the year, we also focused on strengthening our digital channels. A highlight was the Sicredi app, through which we seek to offer a complete relationship for our members, with self-service and personalized incentives. In 2022, we made advances in both functionalities and offering actions, meeting the needs of members and bringing more convenience and ease and adding points of relationship with our audiences. Among the main features of the application, we highlight Favorites Management, which provides more security in transactions for recurring recipients. In addition, Push Pix credit was implemented — an alert to members without a Pix balance, which suggests taking out credit to carry out the transaction. In our channel aimed at receiving legal entities, we have had several technical developments, such as functionality of the Agent Sacador, which provides the functionality of Pix Saque and Pix Troco, reducing the cost of cash management. GRI FS14 Regarding payment methods, we rely on the use of digital wallets, such as ApplePay, vehicle credit and payroll loans, which can be contracted in the app, giving the member more autonomy. 98 99 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022OFFER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS WITH POSITIVE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTALAnother digital tool that advanced during the year was the Sicredi Also at Sicredi X, we made improvements to the application's home interface, enabling greater clarity and agility, with shortcuts to the most used products and more assertive communication. With a focus on security digital, we implemented the mobile token, which enabled a significant reduction in fraud problems. In Internet Banking, we make the consultation profile available to the secondary user, an important initiative for those members who share the management of their business with their employees. In addition, we provide consultation of Pix keys for receipt linked to a QR Code, which allows entrepreneurs to make internet banking a cash front for their establishment, receiving your sales instantly. GRI FS14Digital evolution We live in a global context of transformation, in which countries, organizations and people are increasingly connected. In line with this process, the incorporation of digital solutions has become an essential part of the business of financial institutions, both to optimize processes and to provide more convenience to members. We remain focused on offering products and services each increasingly connected, accessible and aligned with the digital evolution of the financial sector. We do this while keeping our cooperative essence alive, which values ​​relationships and places the member at the center of the business model. We believe that digital will reinforce these ties, generating value and developing the communities where we are present, both physically and digitally. Our digital evolution is guided by the Fisital service model, which strengthens the digital relationship option, without losing the essence and difference of human service, as this is the member's decision. In 2022, we made important advances in the use of the digital platform, in the individual segment. The main highlights were: Account opening via the Sicredi In this model, we now allow opening accounts for new members via the application. Capture and conversion is done by sending an invitation, used by cooperatives to achieve their growth strategies. Through this channel, we had more than 17 thousand new members. Number of members: One of the main milestones in this process was reaching the level of more than 500 thousand new members on the new platform. Associate migration: An important point in our digital evolution is migration gradual transition of members from the current operation to the new platform. In 2022, we began the migration of associates, an important step forward as we continue on the journey of changing the core. Savings account offer for under 18s: Initiative starting in January, reaching more than 25 thousand new savers. Aligned with the dynamics of entrepreneurs, we offer the return of amounts, a function that makes the return process faster and more fluid . To make it even easier In addition to usability, filters were included in the transactions, allowing the search by type of transaction and totalizers, which make viewing faster. In addition, we offer the generation of a reconciliation Excel file for download, which gives more autonomy and agility for checking sales and closing the cash register. GRI FS14 Finally, thinking about facilitating the day-to-day lives of members who need to print their current account statement to carry out their reconciliations, we provide the option of consulting the blocked balance and identifying beneficiaries for TED, PIX and TEF, with more complete information to integrate into your management systems, generating greater transparency about your financial life and reducing the need to handle statements and physical reconciliations. GRI FS14 100 101 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022OFFER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS WITH POSITIVE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTOffer account for members under 18 years of age: Initiative that began in June, having reached more than 8 thousand new members under 18 years of age. Action engine: A platform that captures the needs of members and sends solutions to meet them, aiming to increase principality. With this initiative, we impacted almost 500,000 platform members and more than 20 million shipments. INNOVATE TOGETHER Created in 2018, Inovar Juntos was one of the first initiatives of our journey of digital evolution and emerged as a way to bring us closer to the startup ecosystem to seek opportunities for the development of our business. In the program, startups sign up to participate in innovation challenges, offering solutions according to our needs. The entire development process occurs through our interaction with startups and, when the project is selected, these companies can be hired as suppliers or partners. In In 2022, the program had 12 ongoing projects focused on issues such as improvements in member experience and optimization of areas such as cognition, open finance, payment methods and marketing, among others. Over its five years, more than 660 startups have participated in the program, with significant results for the business. Find out more at Innovar Juntos (http://bit.ly/41pOty6) WITHIN VOICE REACH: VIRTUAL ASSISTANT ARRIVES AT ALEXA In December 2022, we announced the integration of our virtual assistant, Theo, to Amazon's voice control system, Alexa. The new functionality provides members and the general public with another quick, dynamic and secure contact option for making inquiries and accessing our services via voice command. The new contact option is part of our ongoing digital evolution strategy, which includes service channels, leaving it up to the member to choose how they prefer to be served. Initially, The voice assistant device serves some products such as cards, current accounts and PIX, in addition to answering questions about Sicredi and credit unions. For 2023, the system will gradually expand service to other query functions that are part of our entire ecosystem of solutions.Open finance For Open Finance, an initiative by the Central Bank of Brazil to create a more open and transparent financial system through sharing of data between institutions, 2022 was a year of discoveries, with the registration of new use cases on the market. This large network, which turns 2 years old in April 2023, has been growing stronger. There are already more than 226 thousand shares, which benefited 128 thousand members – resulting in R$89 million converted into business. Throughout the year, we implemented some projects to ensure a positive experience for associates and employees. To strengthen the focus on data, we delivered a project in partnership with Pluggy through the Inovar Juntos program (learn more on page 102). By extracting and organizing the information obtained via Open Finance with the member's consent, we are able to evaluate movements to offer the most appropriate solutions for each profile and need. Furthermore, we were able to evolve even further in data analysis, generating dashboards for consultation. An important achievement of 2022 was the qualification of Sicredi as an Initiating Institution of Payment (ITP). This new feature allows us to offer this new transactional phase of Open Finance to our member base, which creates a wide range of opportunities for us. With it, members will be able to safely carry out financial transactions on the Sicredi app, initially via Pix, using balances from different banks. All initiatives were planned and built to ensure the best experience for employees and users, including education, internal marketing and external communication – such as the advertising campaign launched at the end of December. 102 103 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022OFFER FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS WITH POSITIVE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTOur financial solutions Our financial solutions are developed to meet the needs of members, directly impacting their prosperity, income, financial security and well-being, in addition to generating value for communities where they live.

In the 2022/2023 Harvest Plan, we expect to disburse R$50.6 billion in credit lines aimed at rural producers. In 2022, we will make more than R$10 billion available to family farming through Pronaf (National Program for Strengthening Family Agriculture) . The total credit released by the program was 30% higher than that recorded in the same previous period. During the year, 153 thousand credit operations were carried out via Pronaf.

The product already has a portfolio of more than R$90 million. Throughout the year, we presented a series of initiatives aimed at meeting the agro segment: Harvest Survey In 2022, we will make the Sicredi Harvest Survey available. From the initiative, we acquired the capacity to produce and provide intelligence for agribusiness with greater speed and scope, generating value and closer proximity to our associates. Using the tool, in the long term, we will be able to compare the progress of the current harvest with past harvests, increasing the possibility of making our own projections of national production of grains. The Sicredi Harvest Survey is an exclusive project in Brazilian agribusiness, comparable to the work of large public bodies, such as the USDA (United States) and CONAB (Brazil). Agro Program The Agro Program aims to provide, on the Sicredi Aprendi platform, complete training on the legal, technical and operational aspects that encompass Rural and Directed Credit, in order to level the knowledge of employees who work with the segment.CPR Fácil In April 2022, we launched CPR Fácil, a 100% digital solution, which allows the contracting of the Rural Product Certificate (CPR) through the application and enables socio-environmental validation through the contractor's CPF, in order to meet agile credit needs and simple of members of the agro segment.

Of the operations carried out, 632 were for cooperatives, associations and foundations, where we serve 114 different institutions. New Foreign Exchange Law On December 29, 2021, Law 14,286 was published – “New Foreign Exchange Law”, which establishes a new legal framework for the market of exchange. The Law came into force on December 31, 2022 and is intended to establish a modern, concise and legally more legal framework safe, aligned with the best practices of the international market. Furthermore, it aims to simplify, modernize and bring more efficiency to the Brazilian foreign exchange market. Following the new law, we made some moves to adapt processes and use of technology. Quotations and the formalization of operations, for example, will become more digital, reducing the involvement of people, who will be able to dedicate themselves to service and the business. Finimp Local spending During the year, we launched the Finimp Local expenses, a new line of financing that allows the importing member to carry out their imports without the need to have their own capital. The operation allows all costs of nationalizing imported goods to be financed. Pilot of the Trade Finance operation for Women Entrepreneurs (BOW GTFP IFC) In May 2022, we carried out the first funding within the IFC's Banking on Women Global Trade Finance Program, aimed at finance companies in Foreign Trade lines that have more than 51% women in their share capital. To expand service in foreign exchange operations, we started relationships with over 2,060 new associates, of which 57% are legal entities and 43% individuals. Throughout the year, we registered significant interest from cooperatives in exchange products, with some investing in specialists in the segment to provide support to members and, consequently, carry out a greater number of businesses. In line with this initiative, we implemented a support pillar for cooperatives, which acts as support for agencies and headquarters, and is responsible for assisting managers and advisors. We also deliver the COMEX Portal, with the aim of providing a better experience for members while also bringing operational efficiency. The software allows the member to build their own operation and for data and documents to be kept at their disposal, allowing them to make inquiries at any time. In its first phase, the COMEX Portal is intended to be operational software, while in the second it will become business software. In 2023, we plan to deliver a complementary initiative to the COMEX Portal, which will allow members to perform self-service and be able to contract their operations without the need for telephone contact. 112 113 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022OFFERING FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS WITH POSITIVE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTConsortia In 2022, our consortium operation surpassed the mark of 26.9 billion in active credit portfolio, standing out as one of the largest operations in the country. To facilitate the day-to-day lives of our consortium members, during the year, we launched the Consórcio do Sicredi application, a new mobile solution for member self-service. Through the channel, the consortium member can make queries and transactions autonomously, without the need to travel to your agency. Since its publication in app stores, more than 951,000 events have been accessed on the app, including transactions and queries, allowing members greater transparency about their financial life. We also provide a digital channel for withdrawing credit from the consortium quota in cash, without the need to go to the branch and sign physical documents. The new feature brought agility to the process, with the service is carried out, on average, in two hours, and payments, as a rule, occur within the same day of the request. More than a thousand consortium members benefited from this improvement. In 2022, we also signed up our consortium to the Receivable Values ​​System (SVR), a service that allows individuals and legal entities to consult the Central Bank page (valoresareceber.bcb. gov.br), if they have amounts receivable from banks and other institutions in the financial system. For Promote the importance of financial discipline, we hold Itinerant Assemblies and Business Roundtables in Consortia, events in which we demonstrate the role of the consortium in financial education and in achieving personal goals and projects. Throughout the year, more than 4 thousand members attended these events. Thinking about the socio-environmental impact of our products and services, we rely on the Sustainable Consortium (learn more on page 121). Insurance We believe that products insurance policies function as an important mechanism for the financial resilience of members, fundamental for building a more prosperous society. In 2022, through differentiated service and consultancy work, we provided our policyholders with more than R$2 billion in compensation sinister. The amount was impacted by climate events in property and agricultural insurance, and also by the impact of life insurance during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first In 2022, we experienced a strong drought in several regions of Brazil, which caused more than 60 thousand Proagro Insurance (Agricultural Activity Guarantee Program) activations. In this way, we compensated over R$2.4 billion reais to members through this product. It is worth noting that Proagro's main task is to protect agricultural production from climatic events and other risks involved in food cultivation, in addition to protecting the health of credit granted by cooperatives throughout the harvest. During the year, we adhered to the Principles of Sustainability in Insurance (PSI). With this, we include environmental and social issues in our decision-making process, both in the creation of new products, such as Photovoltaic Solar Panel Insurance (learn more in the box on the side), and in the establishment of mechanisms to prevent Private Agricultural Insurance from crops in embargoed areas or reserves.NEW INSURANCE PRODUCTS Travel Insurance We launched, through a partnership with the SulAmérica Seguros group, Travel Insurance, to cover air and sea travel, with national and international coverage. Among the services, the plan covers mandatory insurance for tourism, including Covid-19, coverage for exchanges and long stays, in addition to the preventive model for health and property cases. The policies are valid for coverage for trips of up to 365 calendar days.

GRI FS7 | FS8 We consider it important to create financial solutions that, in addition to improving the lives of members, generate a positive impact on society and the environment, contributing to the action agenda against global climate change. We therefore offer a series of credit lines aligned with the Green Economy, a classification given to financial products and services that enable the improvement of people's well-being and the social equality while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcity. GRI FS7 | FS8 The Green Economy's main pillars are: • Low carbon emissions; • Efficiency in the use of resources; • Social inclusion. In 2022, we allocated R$34.2 billion in credit aimed at the Green Economy. GRI FS7 | FS8To carry out a survey of which financial solutions fit into this line, we used as a basis the green taxonomy methodology of Febraban, which considers sector criteria and financing lines and programs with environmental and social benefits, allowing greater standardization in measurements of the national financial system. GRI FS7 | FS8 Throughout 2020, Febraban reviewed the parameters and guidelines of the Green Economy taxonomy in conjunction with a consultancy specialized in the topic and the support of the financial institutions involved in the process. In this way, just as in 2021, in 2022 we continue reviewing our internal methodology aimed at measuring this data. In this update, the classification criteria were revised, with increases in existing classifications, as well as the insertion of new sustainable lines aligned with Sicredi's strategies. GRI FS7 | FS8 One of the highlights among the products aligned with the Green Economy is financing for solar energy, through which members can obtain credit to purchase equipment and technology for capturing solar energy and generating clean electrical energy in your homes, businesses and rural properties.

In January 2022, we issued our first Green Bond abroad. Green Bonds are debt securities issued specifically for finance projects with environmental benefits. This issuance was made with IDB Invest, a member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in the amount of USD 100 million, covering 100% of the resources destined to financing new photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency projects. In April 2022, we raised USD 100 million to finance micro, small and medium-sized Brazilian companies led by women. Resources were mobilized by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, with participation from BNP Paribas and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). This is a loan with a social bias, aimed at micro, small and medium-sized companies and including the gender factor as a criterion for the use of resources. The financing will be allocated to those companies with annual revenue of up to R$6 million and which have women as owners or partners holding more than 50% of the share capital. The initiative contributes to SDGs to which Sicredi is committed as a member of the UN Global Compact. In the operation, objectives 5, 8 and 10 are being met, which seek to promote gender equality, decent work and economic growth and reduce inequalities. We also launched the first Sustainable Financial Bill in the Brazilian market, raising US$151.4 million, with resources converted into credit for projects aligned with sustainability. You Eligibility criteria selected for granting credit were based on the Sustainable Finance Framework, which contains green and social categories. The Framework was validated (Second Party Opinion) by the Dutch company Sustainalytics, which attests to the document's alignment with international standards and principles. ESG RATING In 2022, we underwent an assessment by Morningstar Sustainalytics, a company that evaluates and classifies risks ESG of companies. We received a score of 15.9, being considered a company with “Low Risk” of suffering financial impacts arising from ESG factors. As a result, we are among the 20 best “Diversified Banks” – out of 400 evaluated globally. Among the issues evaluated, it is worth highlighting our positive performance in the Corporate Governance category, achieved by our ESG governance indicators, sustainability policies and fiscal transparency, in addition to being signatories to the Global Compact for UN. Our risk management was also well evaluated due to the use of the GRI standard in the construction of our Sustainability Report, providing transparency in accountability to investors and the general public. Furthermore, ESG issues are the responsibility of our Board of Directors, which demonstrates its integration with the business.

GRI 3-3 Based on the lines of defense model, risk teams act independently from the business areas and internal audit, dedicated to identifying, controlling and mitigating factors that could compromise the sustainability of the business in the short and medium term. and long term, contributing to the maintenance of our solidity and confidence. We consider in our process risk management: Strategic risks, Financial risks and Non-financial risks. Thus, we guarantee the effectiveness of the process, working to evaluate the most comprehensive technical aspects of the risks and reporting or indicating to the Board actions for specific deliberations. Our policies and standards comply with legal requirements and market practices and are reviewed annually, with the aim of maintaining the consistency of guidelines, rules and procedures. A Risk Appetite Statement (RIS) is a systemic document that aligns our appetite with different types of risks, defines alerts and limits, in addition to facilitating the dissemination of the risk management culture in the System. Our appetite for risk is informed by our strategic vision. All institutions that make up the System must follow the RAS and all actions contained in strategic planning must be compatible with the appetite for risks described in the document.Ensure integrated risk management Risks are assessed for each new action that could potentially increase their impact on our results, assets and liquidity, considering, whenever possible, stress scenarios and mitigating measures. GRI 3-3 Its management includes monitoring indicators and monthly reporting to the committees that support Sicredipar's Board of Directors in deliberations related to policies and guidelines. risk management and prudential limits to be observed. GRI 3-3 The Board has the support of the Risks and Compliance Committee to identify risks and opportunities related to the topics discussed. STRESS TESTS To assess potential impacts of adverse events on the business, we developed a Stress Testing Program. SASB FN-CB-550 a.2 The methodologies used in stress tests must be compatible with the risk management needs of each institution. The stress testing program of all institutions in the System must use, at a minimum, the methodologies and procedures required for their respective segment. Program methodologies and procedures must ensure the use of appropriately severe adverse assumptions and parameters. Stress tests must be carried out in an integrated manner for all risks, evaluating the impact of significant concentrations of risks. This way, we guarantee that the impacts on capital and liquidity are assessed considering the adverse events foreseen in the Program. Each institution's Stress Testing Program is submitted for approval to the respective Board of Directors. The results of the Stress Test Program for cooperatives, central offices and the Bank's Prudential Conglomerate are assessed by the Risk Committee of SicrediPar and Banco, as well as by the Executive Board, through its advisory forum, the Technical Committee for Scratchs.

Therefore, we have detailed mechanisms to mitigate the risks of these operations, as well as assess their impacts on the business and the communities in which we operate. GRI 3-3 To boost our socio-environmental management, we rely on the Socio-Environmental Risk Management Policy, revised in 2022, in compliance with new Resolutions 4,945 and 4,943 of the Central Bank of Brazil. GRI FS1 The policy establishes the guidelines for managing socio-environmental risks in all entities of the System, in order to prevent financial, legal or reputational losses arising from social, environmental or climatic. GRI 2-23 | FS1 We also have a Socio-Environmental Risk Management Standard, which establishes the guidelines and consolidates the rules applicable to associates whose activities are exposed to social, environmental or climate risks and have relevant proportionality in our portfolio. GRI 2-23 | FS1 The procedures established in both documents guide the stages of the credit cycle, as well as the creation and maintenance of our financial services, and are guided by the principles established by the Central Bank. GRI 2-23 | FS1 Throughout the year, we evolved in identifying socio-environmental opportunities in our portfolio, reinforcing processes, metrics and consolidating interactions with business partners.

GRI FS5 Demonstrating the increasing importance of the topic, we carried out several reports, technical discussions and cooperation agreements with business partners, such as with IDB Invest, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), the Société de Promotion et de Participation pour la Coopération Economique (PROPARCO) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). In these dialogues, we share data, analysis and advances in socio-environmental risk management procedures, in addition to making new commitments with plans and actions to improve internal processes related to the topic. Among these agreements is our commitment to adopting reporting standards, in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). GRI FS5 126 127 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022ENSURE INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SELF-DECLARATION QUESTIONNARIES In our credit granting process, we apply self-declaratory questionnaires to associates whose activities have greater exposure to socio-environmental risks, functioning as a signal of possible problems or irregularities. From this, a qualitative assessment of the document is carried out, supporting decision-making for concessions to this member. In line with the social, environmental and climate agenda, in 2022 we expanded the implementation of questionnaires for granting credit to legal entities in the mining sector. Thus, throughout the year we had 58,009 questionnaires in force, of which 56.52% were applied to legal entity (PJ) members, a number significantly higher than the previous year. GRI FS10 PROHIBITED AND DELIMITED ACTIVITIES As described in the internal Socio-Environmental Risk Management Standard, we have established criteria for the composition of the System's credit portfolio, delimiting or prohibiting certain activities with greater exposure to socio-environmental risk. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 In the granting process, we carry out a systemic blockade that prevents the release of credit to members (and their respective economic groups) registered in the Register of employers who subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery, published by the Ministry of Labor”. We also carry out additional checks to assess involvement in non-recommended activities such as the extraction or sale of wood from illegal native forests, for example. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 SCREENING We evaluate the requested credit proposals and the areas to be benefited, if any, by through documentation and elements that support our decision. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 We carry out systemic blocking of products with greater exposure to socio-environmental risk for members and their respective economic groups included in the official lists of environmental embargoes published by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (IBAMA) and the Chico Mendes Institute of Preservation of Biodiversity (ICMBio). GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 These cases are subjected to a specialized assessment, which can generate an opinion for the continuity of the flow of credit granting in situations in which the area to be benefited is not the location subject to the embargo and in which socio-environmental risks are mitigated, observing the reservations and conditions deemed necessary. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 The member remains blocked while on the official lists and this screening is carried out with each new request for a product with greater exposure to socio-environmental risk. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 In 2022, we carried out 693 screenings, 13.28% of which were carried out on legal entity (PJ) members. GRI FS10 Find out below about the social, environmental and climate risk management practices adopted in our operations: GEOPROCESSING We use geoprocessing systems to assess the areas of greatest socio-environmental risk in our rural credit operations, online with the mandatory capture and sending of coordinates established by the Central Bank. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 Based on the geodetic coordinates of the area to benefit from financing, as well as those accepted as collateral, we automatically validate whether there is an overlap with risk areas officially disclosed by the responsible supervisory bodies. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 In this pre-grant validation, a “restriction” message is issued when overlaps with Environmental Preservation Areas and Areas of Relevant Ecological Interest are identified, or a “prohibition” message when overlaps with indigenous lands, quilombola lands, embargoed areas or full-use conservation units are identified. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 Furthermore, we validate and prohibit cases of rural credit in which the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) of the property is inserted in the Amazon Biome and has overlap with environmental embargoes. In these prohibitive situations, continuity of financing is prevented. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 | FN-CB-410a.2 POST-CONCESSION MONITORING After the concession, the benefited areas continue to be monitored throughout the useful life of the operation, in order to verify their regularity. This initiative expanded the scope of our processes, establishing a new level of mitigation of socio-environmental risks, limiting damage and exposure unwanted in areas of greater risk. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 RISK APPETITE MONITORING (RAS) AND PERFORMING STRESS TESTS We establish metrics and monitor our concessions and our credit portfolio, at a regional and systemic level, in order to monitor and limit our exposure to risks. In addition, we carry out stress tests in which we simulate scenarios of exposure to different types of risks to understand how they interact with each other. themselves and can impact our main indicators. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 QUANTITATIVE TOOLS FOR MANAGING PORTFOLIO RISKS In 2022, we continue to improve quantitative management tools based on mechanisms that measure aspects related to the social, environmental and climate risks of the portfolio and counterparties, allowing their classification and analysis. For the next year, in line with data-driven decision guidance, we will aim to development, improvement and application of new quantitative methodologies that allow the management of these risks to evolve. GRI FS 2 | FN-CB-410a.1 INTERLOCUTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND BUSINESS PARTNERS We continue to expand dialogue with environmental bodies through integration actions, aiming to disseminate regularization, awareness and risk mitigation practices. Likewise, we made commitments to develop risk processes socio-environmental issues with multilateral organizations, in which we carry out periodic reports. Furthermore, in 2022, we strengthened our relationship with new business partners, as well as progressing in the standardization of information for measurement and reporting to the market.

GRI FS9 Furthermore, periodically, the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), through its Compliance Report and specific questionnaires, also monitors compliance with SARB14 self-regulation and Central Bank resolutions. GRI FS9 In 2022, stakeholder Rabo Partnerships conducted a process of assessing the organization's conformity, evaluating the structure, policies and standard compliance procedures, as well as mitigating socio-environmental risks, considering the strategies, processes and regulations that encompass the theme. GRI FS9The Central Bank of Brazil continued to periodically evaluate the implementation of regulations and the application of practices socio-environmental risks, increasing the emphasis on aspects of social, environmental and climate risks, throughout 2022. GRI FS9 Training in social, environmental and climate risks Among the training carried out focusing on the topic during the year, we highlight the online training on Risks and Socio-environmental Opportunities, mandatory for all System employees, 93.25%, which totaled 36,923 participants in 2022. GRI 3-3 | Sicredi SR07 In the internal reinforcement of processes, we had 1,045 participations from multipliers in the centers and cooperatives, with the aim of disseminating and improving the practices adopted. The centralized Socio-Environmental Risk management team has intensified its specializations on the topic through courses, participation in lectures, congresses, forums, workshops and working groups with other financial institutions, aiming at qualification and exchange of experiences. GRI FS4Identification and mitigation of climate risks According to the definitions of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), climate risk is divided into two main categories: • Transition risks: the possibility of financial or reputational losses occurring in the move towards a low-carbon economy, through environmental policies or strategies; • Physical risks: the possibility of losses due to climate change generated by environmental degradation, such as deforestation, soil degradation and pollution, or meteorological phenomena, such as the acceleration of global warming, which can cause damage to property, productivity and production of value chains. GRI 201-2 In this sense, we always seek to evolve in the identification of impact factors, to define methodologies and strategies aligned with the sustainability of the business. Throughout 2022, we continued to participate in the discussions of the working group of the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), aimed at supporting institutions on the topic. Among the techniques discussed at the forum and which are already being applied in internal surveys and analyzes is the Climate Risk Sensitivity Ruler, a methodology that aims to identify exposure to climate risk in the agriculture and livestock portfolios of financial institutions, based on the recommendations of the TCFD. GRI 201-2 Furthermore, through the Green Taxonomy, a methodology also developed by Febraban to portfolio classification, we monitor and report, to cooperatives and centers, the portfolio's exposure to climate change, according to the activity of our members. This sectoral exposure variable to climate risks is also reported in our credit treadmill analysis report and is considered in the modeling to measure socio-environmental risk. GRI 201-2 Furthermore, seeking to guarantee legal certainty on the topic, we introduced into our standard clause socio-environmental responsibility the item of climate change, highlighting the importance of adopting control practices and compliance with applicable legislation. Furthermore, we are developing a stress test to evaluate different climate risk scenarios for the institution, allowing a quantitative measurement of these implications, complementing that already applied to socio-environmental risk. GRI 201-2 In 2023, we will remain active in discussions on the topic, improving our geoprocessing tools, carrying out new studies and searching for new sources of data to support and support our mitigation processes, as well as identifying opportunities related to aspects of climate risks. GRI 201-2 130 131 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022ENSURE INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENTEngaging suppliers in a sustainable wayWorking with suppliers and partners with sustainable management To expand our positive impact, We extend our concerns and advances regarding sustainability to the systemic supply chain, encouraging them to adopt the best social and environmental practices. GRI 3-3 This relationship is guided by the Internal Corporate Purchasing Standard, which guides the hiring and management of suppliers that will be used by the System. The guideline indicates that suppliers should preferably be associated with one of our cooperatives, in order to generate more value to the our business chain. We also prioritize suppliers from the communities where we are present, as part of the strategy to contribute to local development. GRI 3-3 During the year, we hired 109,788 active suppliers, with whom we spent R$7.4 billion. GRI 3-3 Our main suppliers deliver everything from corporate supplies to more complex service and technology solutions, located throughout the country. The main suppliers responsible for Threshold solutions to the process are based in the South, Southeast and North regions. GRI 2-6At the Sicredi Administrative Center (CAS), we include a standard clause relating to sustainability as a model in our contracts, through which suppliers commit to acting responsibly. We also recommend the inclusion of anti-corruption, human rights and environmental clauses in cooperative contracts, addressing issues such as child and slave labor. GRI 308-2 During the year, we had 250 new contracts that were subjected to environmental impact assessment. Of these, 82% had a sustainability clause included. GRI 308-1 | 414-1 For suppliers that undergo Council deliberation, we carry out a socio-environmental analysis based on a form completed by the supplier. GRI 308-2 In 2022, we began the process of creating the Sustainability Guidelines – Sustainable Management of Suppliers and Partners, which have the objective of deepening the directions that make up the Sustainability Policy, guiding the Sicredi System towards best practices on the subject. The Guidelines are guiding and systemic. GRI 308-2PROMOTE ECO-EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT Promote eco-efficient managementTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SPRINGS IN RURAL PROPERTIES Through a partnership with the Riograndense Association of Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Enterprises (Emater/RS), the cooperative Sicredi Serrana and the cooperative Sicredi Pioneira, from Central Sicredi Sul/Southeast, offer technical assistance and support to rural owners for the conservation of springs and the environment. Within the scope of Sicredi Serrana, in the first year water capture systems, protection of springs and restoration of permanent preservation areas (APPs) were built in 23 rural properties in municipalities in the regions of Caxias do Sul and Lajeado. For the next two years, another 115 properties will benefit. In the region covered by Sicredi Pioneira, where the project began in October, 66 springs will be restored or preserved on 66 rural properties. Of this amount, 11 are APPs, called URs – Reference Units, one in each municipality, with in-depth preservation and restoration work. Upon completion, each UR will be suitable for visitation, educational and awareness-raising purposes. In the remaining 55 properties, the focus of work will be the preservation of the springs. At the end of the projects, the areas will be available for visitation, for educational and awareness-raising purposes. The projects last three years and the cooperatives pay 70% of the total value, with 30% given in return by the rural producer. We see Eco-efficient Management as one that aims for maximum efficiency in the use of material and natural resources, with the minimum of adverse impact on the environment and generating positive. Furthermore, we understand that eco-efficient management does not only apply to our direct operations, but also to our value chain. GRI 3-3 With this objective, we have several systemic and local eco-efficiency initiatives, which have been advancing over time. Systemic initiatives are represented by the Emissions and Climate Change Management Front, which includes the Measurement of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions, in addition to the annual Neutralization of 100% of emissions calculated in the Inventory and emission reduction actions. (Learn more on page 136). Among the local eco-efficiency initiatives developed by cooperatives, we can mention units with sustainable construction attributes, conservation and recovery projects for springs, solid waste reduction and energy efficiency actions. 132 133 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022ACTING WITH SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS WITH SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENTSystem Eco-Efficiency Program Sicredi Throughout 2022, we worked on structuring our Eco-efficiency Program, which aims to contextualize the topic within our Sustainability Strategy and align with the entire System how we put eco-efficient management into practice. The Program also aims to systematize what we already do and identify new opportunities to advance further. Sicredi's Eco-efficiency Program is structured into two main fronts: ECO-EFFICIENT OPERATION: Seeks to explore opportunities to make our processes and operations even more efficient from an economic and environmental point of view, covering the topics of solid waste management, sustainable constructions and operational processes. EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT: It aims to expand our contribution to a positive agenda of action against global climate change, at the same time that we collaborate with the development of the regions where we are present, taking into account the themes of measurement, neutralization and reduction of emissions. LEED RECERTIFICATION In 2022, we received LEED recertification for the Centro Administrativo Sicredi (CAS) building, located in Porto Alegre. The structure obtained a final score of 88 points, winning first place among 12 certified buildings in Brazil in 2022 in the Operation and Maintenance category. LEED – Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is a international certification for sustainable constructions. CAS is the only building in Rio Grande do Sul certified in the “LEED – operation and maintenance of existing buildings” category. Emissions and Climate Change Management We understand that the main challenges of our Eco-efficiency Program are related to the Emissions and Climate Change Management front, considering that this is a highly relevant topic for the financial sector, which plays a crucial role in help the world transition to a low-carbon economy. In a planetary context in which companies and organizations will increasingly need to revisit their forms of production and services, financial institutions will be able to contribute, THE PAGE CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE LINK: https://www.sicredi.com.br/site / about-us/sustainability/climate-changes/through its operations, so that low-carbon projects and activities are made viable. To centralize our communication and systematize the financial and non-financial solutions we develop in relation to this topic, in 2022 we launched the Sicredi Climate Change page, in which we address our different initiatives that contribute to action against global climate change. 134 135 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTING ECO-EFFICIENT MANAGEMENTMEASUREMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS As a way of increasingly contributing to the agenda to combat climate change, We measure our carbon emissions annually through the systemic Emissions Inventory. The inventory provides a snapshot of the emissions of all our cooperatives and CAS, and allows us to develop strategies to reduce or neutralize the impact of our operations in terms of climate change. Our Inventory is calculated according to the methodology of the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program, covering scopes 1, 2 and 3 and being recognized with the Gold Seal, the highest level of qualification for corporate carbon inventories. SCOPE 1: These are our direct emissions, such as those arising from gases from the air conditioning systems used in our structures. SCOPE 2: These are emissions related to the purchase of electricity from our operation. SCOPE 3: These are indirect emissions, but which are necessary for our operations, such as, for example, those related to the transport of cash and business trips. We understand the need to expand the scope of Scope 3 of our Inventory, including measuring emissions from our financed activities. With this objective, we started mapping to evolve in the measurement of financed emissions throughout 2023, which will give us more inputs to help our members with the challenges of the climate agenda.

In 2022 we evolved our strategy: in addition to neutralizing the emissions calculated in the 2021 Inventory, we advanced the compensation of emissions projected for the entire year 2022. To this end, we supported six carbon credit projects located in different regions of Brazil, totaling more than 45 thousand tons of carbon neutralized. We use as selection criteria audited, certified projects with strict quality standards, which result in positive impacts in the social, environmental and economic spheres and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in addition to being representative of our regions. performance. Reduction Actions In terms of reducing emissions, several of our production units service, our agencies and administrative headquarters of cooperatives and also the CAS have self-generation of renewable energy. In 2022, we had more than 500 units with self-generation of photovoltaic energy, which saved 574 tons of carbon. Furthermore, the purchase of energy from renewable sources2 from the incentivized market carried out by CAS resulted in 234 tons of carbon reduction in 2022. 2 Renewable sources: wind and solar plants, small plants hydroelectric plants, biomass and biogas plants. In 2022 we also evolved the scope of our Emissions Inventory, starting to measure the emissions avoided from the release of resources to finance photovoltaic energy generation projects. We calculate that, through the release of these resources, the emissions of 35,352 tons of carbon from our members were avoided in 2022. As members of the UN Global Compact, committed to complying with its guidelines and the Sustainable Development Goals, we seek to align our systemic emissions reduction strategy with best international practices. FIND OUT ABOUT THE PROJECTS ON THE WEBSITE: https://www.sicredi.com.br/site/sobre-nos/sistema/ changed-climaticas/projetos/Usina Solar em Mato Grosso In 2022, Central Sicredi Norte began operating a plant Solar in Nova Xavantina (MT), which supplies all Central cooperatives located in Mato Grosso, with the exception of the cooperative Sicredi Araxingu, which has solar self-generation installed in its branches. With an investment of more than R$30 million, the plant operates with 18 thousand photovoltaic panels, with a capacity to generate 5 megawatts (MW) of energy. The estimate is that electricity bills will be reduced by 95%, generating annual savings of approximately R$12 million. The use of renewable energy, generated by the plant, has the potential to avoid the emission of more than 24 thousand tons of carbon in the atmosphere over the next 25 years, contributing to the decarbonization of our energy matrix, thus contributing to the reduction of emissions at a national level. 138 139 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTING ECO-EFFICIENT MANAGEMENTmunicipalities where we are the only financial institution in the employee confidence index in Social Investment 217 89% R$301.3     million 4th place as the best company to work with children and adolescents impacted by programs of education04 Local development FOSTER THE LOCAL ECONOMY _____________________________ 142 PROMOTE FINANCIAL INCLUSION _______________________ 146 PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLE _____________ 150 CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES _________________________________________ 163Promote positive transformations in the locations where we are present +500      thousand related SDGs: 140The presence of a cooperative in a community generates income and prosperity for its inhabitants.

PILLARS FROM THE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM SICREDI COMPETENCIES To maintain the alignment of our culture, we have a catalog of 15 competencies that describe the desired behaviors and guide our employee selection, development and recognition processes. They are fundamental to connecting us to our purpose and showing that change is necessary, while maintaining our cooperative essence. Sicredi RC09 Two of these skills were indicated as essential for the entire System. They are: “Cooperative essence” and “Understand to serve”. The remaining competencies are the free choice of each cooperative. Sicredi RC09 150 151 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTING PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTLearning Culture We seek to develop a Learning Culture that generates an environment that encourages autonomy and the exchange of learning among employees, both in formal and informal environments, fostering the growth of each person and the organization as a whole. This culture is built through values, which must be communicated to direct the attitudes and behaviors we want to see in the different audiences involved with our learning initiatives. The values ​​of our learning culture are: • Essência Sicredi; • Learner Centrality; • Autonomy and Protagonism; • Human Learning Context; • 360º learning; • Network Learning; • Innovability. Architecture learning architecture The design of the Learning Architecture aims to facilitate connections between initiatives, bringing a systemic view of actions and supporting the construction and distribution process with the aim of improving your experience. Learning Architecture ensures the link between business needs and training initiatives, allowing employees to have a better view of the paths and purposes of initiatives, increasing their engagement and autonomy. The thematic axes of our Learning Ecosystem are: • Cooperative Identity; • Skills and Transformation; • Relationship and Business; • Tools, technologies and methods; • Leadership; • Regulatory; • Governance*. * This axis will be made available in 2023.

Below, we list some highlights:Advanced program of governance Faced with an increasingly complex and constantly changing environment, we are invited to look at Corporate Governance from our perspectives. To support us in this transformation process, the Advanced Governance Program (PAG) was developed, with the aim of providing opportunities for discussions about dilemmas in the decision-making process experienced daily by executives and the board when making the commitment to take care of the longevity of the business. In the edition of the Program conducted throughout 2022, in partnership with the ISE Business School, 27 Sicredi directors participated: SicrediPar advisors and executive directors of CAS and Centrals, in a program that covers topics related to strategy, governance, people and business. Share-E Share-E is one of the initiatives that aims to foster a learning culture and enhance one of our values: Network Learning. The goal is to connect what we have to better and the wealth of knowledge and practices carried out by our employees. It is a product designed to be executed organically by employees and has a free theme.Welcome manager Professionals who are taking on a leadership position, or who wish to recycle their knowledge, have the “Welcome Manager” track at their disposal. It contains a variety of content connected to current business transformation challenges, which reinforce your management responsibilities and their role, enabling them to act strategically with a focus on people, processes and results. GRI 404-2 Jeito Sicredi de Ser: In-person training that consists of diving into the world of cooperativism and our culture through the Jeito Sicredi de Ser Workshop and Jogo do Jeito. In them, the employee is introduced to the content of the four axes of our competencies (Cooperativeness, Business, People, Transformation). GRI 404-2 Ignite How An important stage in our evolution process as a Learning Ecosystem, in 2022 we started Ignite, a program that aims to prepare and integrate People Management professionals into the learning culture based on the ecosystem concept. Throughout the meetings, participants had the opportunity to delve into the values ​​of our learning culture and explore ways of putting them into practice. 156 157 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTING THE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENTindica ecosystem To encourage self-directed learning, we launched the Indica Ecosystem, an initiative where relevant events, lectures, content or materials are systemically disseminated for employees to enhance their learning. PF Platform Following the guidelines of digital evolution, we made available on Sicredi Aprendi the PF Platform trail, which includes 18 courses and 11 simulators, allowing employees to perceive, understand and connect with change. The objective is to support you in the transformation we are experiencing, understanding your role as a fundamental part of the relationship with our associates. In total, 12,677 employees have already accessed the trail and 1,801 have completed the courses. GRI 404-2 To provide a differentiated learning experience for employees who work with the PF Platform, in 2022 we launched a course developed using augmented reality. From this new technology of learning, the employee interacts with virtual content and real visualizations. During the trail, he navigates through Cidade Sicredi, going through stories and learning even more about the benefits of the platform. GRI 404-2Change management Still in the context of business transformations, we understand that all employees can be agents of change. And to make them capable of being ambassadors of transformation, we provide a completely revitalized trail on the theme “Management of Change". In it, we support employees' understanding of what a culture of change is, how we can manage the topic and their role in this. In total, we have 253 employees who are taking the trail courses and 123 who have completed them. GRI 404-2 The importance of using data One of our strategic priorities is: “Be excellent in using data”. To support its achievement and acculturate employees, we developed the track “The Importance of Using Data". This track covers everything from basic concepts on how to implement a data-based culture to good practices in data consumption. GRI 404-2 Other initiatives During the year, we launched new content about Pix, Open Finance and Marketplace, themes that represent some of the big changes we are implementing. The available courses and trails consist of short videos, infographics, lives, podcasts and guides to support employees in generating new business and enhance relationships with associates.

The initiative arose from the challenge of connecting and accelerating the learning of employees and the development of our skills so that they are able to execute the strategic priorities of 2023 and enable the inspirational 2030. “Journey to the New World” engaged employees to go through Missions and Challenges that stimulated the realization of a Learning Journey that supported the development of skills related to strategic themes. With each challenge completed, employees were able to redeem their points for learning rewards. What's more, connected with our cooperative purpose and essence, the points of all participants were added together to achieve the collective goal, which was achieved and converted into financial support for those who need it most. So, together we made a difference, and benefited APAE Brasil, a project chosen by all collaborators. In total, 33,225 employees completed one or more challenges. With the positioning of the Learning Ecosystem, we understand that learning is the sum of formal and informal initiatives. With this, we have the ongoing challenge of stimulating new ways of learning, creating spaces for people to share, teach, learn, unlearn and relearn, all together and integrated. To monitor our progress and assess whether we are achieving our objective, we carried out the Perception Survey. 92% assessed that the Ecosystem increased learning possibilities. 158 159 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022PROMOTING PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENTEmployee satisfaction In 2022, we continued to use the Great Place to Work (GPTW) methodology to carry out our climate research. More than 29 thousand employees contributed their perception of what it's like to work at Sicredi and, as a result, we were once again certified by GPTW as a excellent place to work. We reached a confidence index of 89% — one percentage point above last year and our highest historical score in the System. We were also recognized in 4th place as the best company to work for in the country in the “Financial Institutions – Credit Cooperatives” category by GPTW. The ranking is published annually and rewards the best companies to work for at a national, regional, sectoral and thematic level. This important award is carried out in 53 countries, with the aim of measuring whether the working environments of participating companies are excellent places to work professionally. The search for this recognition, in addition to consolidating our cultural practices and stimulating our constant evolution, adds value to our brand and makes us relevant for attracting new talent capable of boosting our business strategy.Social Investment Due to our cooperative nature, we believe than for To be relevant, we need to do more than generate financial results, we need to generate value for the communities where we are present. In this sense, we developed our social investment strategy, which proposes local development initiatives aligned with our purpose and the principles of cooperativism. GRI 3-3 To measure the impact of our initiatives, we created the Sicredi Social Investment (ISS) indicator, which calculates the total value of resources invested in social actions, environmental, cultural and educational in the System. In 2022, we invested R$301.27 million in actions through FATES, the Social Fund, donations, incentive and sponsorship laws. GRI 3-3FATES From the Technical, Educational and Social Assistance Fund (FATES), we strengthen the principles of cooperativism, offering resources to assist members, their families, and, when provided for in the statutes, employees and the community in their area of action. Cooperatives reserve at least minus 5% of your financial result to FATES. In 2022, R$231.3 million was allocated to FATES, while R$246.4 million was used by cooperatives*.

Therefore, we turned the Sicredi na Comunidade platform, originally conceived at Central Sicredi Centro Norte, into our social investment hub. GRI 3-3 This is a digital platform that uses technology to connect those who want to allocate resources to actions with a positive social impact. In other words, it connects who need who you want to cooperate with. We thus create an interactive ecosystem that highlights the power of cooperation and demonstrates that, together, we create a better world. The hub seeks to keep the essence of cooperativism alive and is connected with our purpose of "Building a more prosperous society together". Therefore, its initiatives take local needs into account and generate bonds of trust, which strengthen the community, associates and, consequently, our business. GRI 413-1 At the end of 2022, we had implemented the Social Fund, Sponsorships and Courses (EAD) initiatives on the platform. The next initiatives to be added will be Volunteering, Donations and Incentive Laws. GRI 413-1Social Fund The Social Fund is a program in which cooperatives allocate a percentage of the previous year's results to support local social projects of collective interest. The supported actions may include practices aimed at education, culture, sport, health, environment, safety and social inclusion.

In this sense, all the projects and actions we support aim, in addition to brand exposure and increased visibility, to bring a positive impact in the regions where we operate. Therefore, we support actions and projects that help make society more prosperous. Due To this end, the sponsorships we conduct are based on three main objectives: Relationship, Brand Exposure and Corporate Citizenship. The projects we support are chosen based on the following pillars: education, local development and cooperation. To facilitate community access, organize requests and bring transparency to the process, we have, within Sicredi na Comunidade, a sponsorship request tool, which can be national, local or regional. The tool also provides autonomy and independence for cooperatives, enabling each one to assess local needs and strategies.

We evaluated the history of 2021 and identified that we jumped from 10 courses available on the sustainability theme to 40 courses in 2022. This demonstrates a greater offer of content which results in a significant increase in hours, but a reduction in relation to the number of employees who took the courses. This is due to two reasons: an increase in the number of employees hired throughout the year who have the option of taking or not carrying out the training as they are freely accessible content of individual interest.1Standard Contents Reference/direct responseRelationship with the principle of the Global Compact MATERIAL THEME: PROMOTING INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY GRI 3 – Material Themes – 20213-1Process for defining material themesPage 46 - 3-2 List of themes materials Pages 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50 - 3-3Management of material topicsPages 80, 81, 82 and 83 - GRI 2: General Contents – 20212-10Appointment and selection for the highest governance bodyPage 34 - GRI 202: Presence in the Market – 2016202-1Proportion between the lowest salary and the local minimum wage, with discrimination by genderFor this indicator, only employees with a workload of 8 hours per day were considered, as we equated them as provided for in the legislation where the Minimum wage is set for a full 8-hour day.

These standards require the auditor to comply with ethical requirements, independence and other related responsibilities, including the application of the Brazilian Quality Control Standard (NBC PA 01) and, therefore, the maintenance of a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures on compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and legal requirements and applicable regulations. EY I 2 / 3 Additionally, the aforementioned standards require that the work be planned and executed with the objective of obtaining limited assurance that the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report, taken as a whole, are free from material distortions. Limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with NBC TO 3000 (ISAE 3000) consists primarily of inquiries to Sicredi management and others Sicredi professionals who are involved in preparing the information, as well as applying analytical procedures to obtain evidence that allows us to conclude, in the form of limited assurance, about the information taken together. A limited assurance work also requires the execution of additional procedures, when the independent auditor becomes aware of matters that lead him to believe that the specific indicators and metrics of sustainability disclosed in the Report, taken together, may present relevant distortions. The procedures selected were based on our understanding of aspects relating to the compilation, materiality and presentation of the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report, other circumstances of the work and our consideration of areas and processes associated with the information materials disclosed in the Report, in which distortions relevant could exist. The procedures included, among others: a) the planning of the work, considering the relevance, the volume of quantitative and qualitative information and the operational and internal control systems that served as the basis for the elaboration of the constant sustainability indicators and metrics On the report; b) understanding the calculation methodology and procedures for compiling indicators through inquiries with managers responsible for preparing information; c) the application of analytical procedures on quantitative information and inquiries into qualitative information and its correlation with the sustainability indicators and metrics disclosed in the information contained in the Report; d) for cases in which sustainability indicators and metrics correlate with indicators of a financial nature, the comparison of these indicators with the financial statements and/or accounting records. The limited assurance work also included adherence to the guidelines and criteria of the GRI Standards, SASB and own criteria applicable in the preparation of the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report. We believe that the evidence obtained in our work is sufficient and appropriate to support our conclusion in the limited form. reach and Limitations Procedures performed in limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are smaller in scope than in reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than that which would be obtained if reasonable assurance engagement had been performed. Had we performed reasonable assurance work, we could have identified other issues and possible distortions that may exist in the sustainability indicators and metrics contained in the Report. Therefore, we do not express an opinion on this information. 204 205 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022ANNEXESGeneral Coordination Cooperative and Sustainability Superintendence Communication Coordination Brand, Communication, Segments and UX Superintendence Data source Sicredi GRI Consultancy, Editorial Coordination and Project Management Ricca sustainability financial data are subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given the nature and diversity of methods used to determine, calculate or estimate these data.
