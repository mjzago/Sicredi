In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present adequately, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperativa de Crédito, Poupança e Investimento Ouro Verde do Mato Grosso - Sicredi Ouro Verde M T on December 31, 2019, the performance of its operations and its cash flows to the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - BACEN. Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Financial Statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and We comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The management of the Cooperative is responsible for this other information that comprises the management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management's report and does not exemplify we press any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management's report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work done, we conclude that there is material misstatement in the management report we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. A member company of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 Management and governance responsibilities for financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and by the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this basis accounting in the preparation of financial statements unless management intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may be due to fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or together, they can influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations. • We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management. 3 • We conclude on the adequacy of management's use of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of adequate presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.
