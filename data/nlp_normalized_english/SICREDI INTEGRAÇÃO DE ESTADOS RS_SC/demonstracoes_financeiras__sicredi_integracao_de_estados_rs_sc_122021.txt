In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material respects, the equity and financial position of the Credit Union, Savings and Investment Integration of States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina - Sicredi Integration of States RS/SC on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Emphasis - Restatement of corresponding amounts We draw attention to explanatory note no. 2, to the financial statements, which describes the restatements made on the amounts corresponding to the year ended December 31, 2020, related to reclassifications of: (i) balances of investments in investment funds for cash and cash equivalents, due to their convertibility immediate, (ii) the balances of inflows from intercooperative deposits for financial intermediation income, due to the nature of the operations, and (iii) the balances of non-operational results for the groups of other inflows and operating revenues and other operating expenditures and expenses , due to the nature of the operations. In this context, the corresponding values ​​for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented for comparison purposes, were adjusted and are being2 restated as provided for in NBC TG 23, or CPC 23 - Accounting Policies, Estimate Changes and Error Rectification. Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Company's Report management and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work done, we conclude that there is material misstatement in the Management Report we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of the financial statements unless the board of directors intend to settle the Cooperative or cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to avoid ceasing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Distortions may result from fraud or error and are considered relevant when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions made based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:3  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute procedures audit in response to such risks, as well as obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures audit appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the Cooperative’s operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, events or conditions Future risks may lead to the Cooperative no longer remaining in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and of significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Restatement of figures comparative: The administration is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from adjustments to rectify errors in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surplus and losses In 2021, a reclassification of inflows of deposits was carried out intercooperatives, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other income and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation.

The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, in order to favor the comparability of the financial statements.
