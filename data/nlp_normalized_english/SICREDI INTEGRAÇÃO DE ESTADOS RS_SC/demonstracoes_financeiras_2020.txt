In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above fairly present, in all material respects, the position balance sheet and financial balance of the Cooperativa de Crédito, Savings and Investment Integration of States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina - Sicredi Integration of States RS/SC on December 31, 2020, the performance of its operations and its cash flows to the year ending on that date, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), including Resolution No. 4. 818 of May 29, 2020 of the National Monetary Council (CMN) and BCB Resolution No. 2 of August 12, 2020 of BACEN. Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with ethical principles relevant provisions set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The management of the Cooperative is responsible for this other information that understand the management report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover management's report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read management's report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the management report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. A member company of Ernst & Young Global Limited 2 Management and governance responsibilities for financial statements Management is responsible for preparing and adequately presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the ability for the Cooperative to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements, unless management intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the governance of the Cooperative are those with responsibility for supervising the process of preparation of financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit performed in accordance with standards Brazilian and international auditing systems, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than o arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. • We have obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We assess the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management. 3 • We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is a material uncertainty regarding events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the ability to operational continuity of the Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, We must draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity. • We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the statements financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

MANAGEMENT REPORT The administration of the Cooperative of Credit, Savings and Investment Integration of States of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina -Sicredi Integration of States RS/SC, in accordance with legal and statutory provisions, publishes the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, together with the independent auditors' report on the Financial Statements. During the 2020 fiscal year, the Board of Directors and Board of Directors of Cooperative acted in several initiatives to contribute to the development of the community where it operates, in addition to social actions. We can highlight semi-presential actions: Structuring Programs, with emphasis on the União FazaVida Program, School Cooperatives, Financial Education, Core Assemblies and the Mais Mulher Event. It is also worth highlighting that, due to the pandemic, we held part of our meetings in person and some in virtual format, and semi-in-person general meetings. Other actions such as courses for producers rural and micro-entrepreneurs, conscious business activation with speaker Thomas and several campaigns on social media to encourage local consumption. It is important to note that from March/20 onwards the meetings of the Board of Directors were all virtual, that we held meetings with the coordinators of semi-presential centers in August and December, the latter to discuss strategic planning and we also worked with the preparation of delegates. Also noteworthy are the supported Social Projects through the Social Fund, a Project in Partnership with COPREL -Electrification Cooperative and the Municipal Government of Passo Fundo/RS with the aim of bringing internet access to rural areas. We also highlight the opening of the Laurentino, Chapadão doLajeado and Lontras branches, all in Santa Catarina, as well as the beginning of works to set up the Sicredi branch in RiodoSul/SC. In Rio Grande do Sul, we started the renovation and expansion of the Centro Agency and the allocation of a room for the installation of the Plataformas Agency in 2021, in the city of Passo Fundo/RS. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have held daily and weekly virtual meetings with agency managers and areas of Sureg, we have also started weekly virtual meetings with all employees to align and activate knowledge, called DROPs. We maintained actions for home office work and audio sessions with people in the risk group who spent practically 8 months at home. We value innovations and new ideas, and we structure projects that seek sustainability, agility, valuing people to face the challenges posed by the pandemic. Coping with the Pandemic Throughout the year we continued to face the new Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic in the country. Sicredi was close to the population, providing the necessary assistance to associates, employees and communities. We take care to prevent the spread of the disease, following the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and other competent bodies to combat the virus; and we kept our mission alive: value the relationship, offer financial solutions to add income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our credit lines remained active and we also made emergency program lines available from the Government. As is intrinsic to our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which makes it possible to expand the range of options suited to each person's needs when facing crisis and business maintenance. In a world marked by human distancing, our electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, app) have made many of our demands viable, they are complete channels that allow us to carry out most operations without having to go to branches. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. By means movements such as People Who Cooperate Care and ICooperate with the Local Economy we take care of people; We focused on the well-being of employees and associates and reaffirmed the strength of cooperatives as a driver capable of contributing to the continuity of economic activity in the country. The cooperative acted strongly during this time of crisis so that the demands of its members were always met. Among the actions to combat the pandemic, we highlight: a) Creation of special credit lines for the pandemic; b) Extension of loan maturities in order to adapt the associates' cash flow; c) Review of pricing in the various credit lines; d) Donations to entities in all municipalities; e) Campaigns to raise funds for those most in need; f) Encouragement of local commerce, including among employees; g) Periodic virtual meetings; g)Relaxation incentives through virtual interactive activities; h) Virtual meeting with all employees and family members at the end of the year.
