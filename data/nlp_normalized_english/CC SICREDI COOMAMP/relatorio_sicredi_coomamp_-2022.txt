The time of real possession was left for virtual or pseudo-possession. Today, we are bombarded with messages or images from people we know or not who insist on demonstrating what they don't have. Others are led to economic collapse by trying to display “a curtain of wealth” that does not is sustained over time. Since it is not enough to be rich, but, above all, you have to demonstrate that wealth! According to Morgan Housel (The Financial Psychology): spending money to show people how much money you have is the quickest way to have less money. Therefore, being rich is not about acquiring luxury consumer goods (cars, clothes, jewelry) or even wasting them on friends. For fortune is exactly the resources not yet converted into these goods, that is, that that is kept. The same author cited continues to distinguish Fortune from Wealth. The latter is very easy to identify: it has to do with current income and its holders strive to demonstrate what they have, whether through cars, houses, etc. While Fortune is something hidden. It's that unspent income, it's the option that hasn't yet been put into practice to buy something one day if necessary. And these concepts are independent of the amount you save. Just come satisfy the usual needs of its owner. Where is our Fortune?4 COOPERATIVA SICREDI C OOMAMP 2022João Leonardo Pires Leal Chairman of the Board of DirectorsCertainly, living with both options (wealth and fortune) becomes a very difficult exercise. Going from being rich to having fortune, ceasing consumption temptations to build financial security, are sometimes painful options for some. After all, turning our attention to the cooperative financial institution to which we belong, these considerations must serve to build our Fortune. Making it our main financial institution, and also for economic planning and our financial education. We know that many learn by imitation by seeing the conduct of others. However, in this case, the hidden nature of fortunes makes it difficult to repeat the same conduct in economic management. The decision at which economic and financial level we should live will be ours. Well, according to the old popular adage: everyone knows where their shoes are tight. 120 YEARS OF SICREDI __ ____________________ ____________ 06 Timeline __ _____ ________ ___________ ________ 08 THE 7 PRINCIPLES OF COOP ERATIVISM __ _____ ______ 10 The Pioneers of Rochdale __ _____ ________ __________ 11 Our cooperative essence __ ___________________ 12120 years of Cooperativeism120 YEARS OF C OOPERAT IVISM 6120 years of SicrediCooperativism: In 2022, Sicredi completed 120 years of history. A journey that was intimately connected with the principles of cooperative activism, generating value for members and communities where we are present. Our origins happened with the founding of the first Credit Cooperative in Brazil, in 1902, by the priest Jesuit T heodor Amstad and a group of German immigrants, small landowners and rural workers from Nova Petrópolis, in Rio Grande do Sul. of associates. +6.5 million cooperatives affiliated credit. +100 agencies spread across the country. +2.4 thousand COOPERATIVA SICRED I COOMAMP 20227Reaching the milestone of 120 years of credit cooperatives in Brazil fills us with pride, as it shows that we are consistently continuing the path that was opened by the German Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen around 150 years ago across the ocean and followed in Brazil by Father Amstad. Fernando Dall’Agnese Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sicredi (SicrediPar)Theodor Amstad was born in Switzerland, in 1851. From a young age, he dedicated himself to community activities in Germany, England and the Netherlands, learning about the importance of cooperative actions for the development of local workers. In Nova Petrópolis (RS), the priest joined 20 local associates and, together, put this collective vision into practice to build a better future. They began a cooperative venture that inspired the creation of many other rural credit banks in the country, in addition to the first Central bringing together Cooperatives, still in the first decades of the 20th century. Over the years, the model that emerged in the Brazilian context, prospered and modernized. From the countryside it arrived in the cities, maintaining over time the purpose of adding income through investments and shared resources, with equal participation and benefits for all members and promoting quality of life. 120 YEARS OF C OPERAT IVISM 8Timeline Get to know some relevant historical facts from our history. 1902 Constitution of the first credit cooperative in Latin America, in Nova Petróp olis/RS, currently Sicr edi Pioneir a RS. 1964 Reformulation of the National Financial System Law n0 4,595/64, which imposed normative restrictions on the function ion of credit cooperatives.1971 Sanctioned by Law No. 5.76 4/71 that the legal regime of cooperative societies.1988 New Federal Constitution establishes favorable regulatory conditions for credit cooperatives.

While other examples, they close agreements with large companies to offer a salary account on a mandatory basis for their employees, in a credit cooperative membership happens automatically. different form. After the presentation on how cooperativism works, everyone can freely choose to join or not. 6 Intercooperation Cooperatives work together to strengthen the cooperative movement. Sicr edi is a living example of this, built by the union of several cooperatives, which grow together in a win-win model, bringing prosperity to their members.7 Interest in the community Credit cooperatives edict may be located in regions with diverse opportunities for social improvements, where institutions have the possibility of profit. In this way, the members hired in the cooperative bring a result to the community, generating income, jobs and growth in the region.2 Democratic management All members have the same voting power, with the same weight in assemblies. This way, everyone decides together on the direction of the cooperative, to deal with issues such as law leadership, remuneration or even the amounts invested in social programs. THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF C OOPERATIVISM Which were born with the Pioneers of Rochdale and which govern cooperatives around the world, have been reformulated over the years to meet the social demands of each era . Its last update was carried out by ACI (International Cooperation Alliance) in 1995. At S icredi, they direct and support us in generating impact positive: COOPERATIVA SICRED I COOMAMP 202213 135 Education, training and information Education, training and information for members is the most solid way to generate prosperity. Based on this principle, cooperatives promote various education programs in the communities where they are present. Examples of this action are the School Cooperatives Program, the A União Faz a Vida Program, the Crescer e Cooperação na Ponta do Lápis Program, which form cooperative citizens who engage in the development of their 3 Economic participation of members Members participate in the economic result of the cooperative, that is, the result of operations generated by the money invested by members returns to their pocket, as decided in a manner democracy in assemblies. 4 Autonomy and independence The cooperative is completely autonomous and independent in its decisions, and can only be controlled by its members, in a model of democratic management.THE PIONEERS OF ROCHDALE Modern cooperativism emerged in the 19th century, in England, with a group of workers who sought to improve their lives and collective prosperity, within a context of the advance of the Industrial Revolution in the country. This scenario brought devastating social impacts to the urban population, such as hunger, poverty, long working hours and child labor. to buy food and essential items, of quality and at fair prices, in 1844, 28 weavers and other craftsmen met and founded the Rochdale Quitable Pioneers Society Limited. Together, they created an alternative that, through cooperation and joint efforts, provided a fairer economic and social model. Each of the associates contributed one pound, an initial investment that helped open the doors of a cooperative warehouse, starting a business completely outside the standards of the time, without employees and bosses, where responsibilities and results were divided equally. The pioneers of Rochdale marked the history of Cooperatives because they understood that values ​​and principles are necessary for an enterprise to grow and maintain its purpose over the years, generating value for everyone involved. 11COOPERATIVA SIC RED I COOMAMP 2022120 YEARS OF C OOPERAT IVISM 12Our cooperative essence CICL O VIRTUOSO By exercising our active role as associates, acting As business owners, we make the cooperative prosperous. While some invest and save, others use this amount in the form of credit to realize their dreams, buy, produce and undertake. In this way, money circulates, moves the local economy and is transformed into the provision of jobs, products and services, income generation and more opportunities. Our business model creates a virtuous cycle that encourages investment in cooperation that promotes business. associates, the growth of the community and the development of the people of the region. Furthermore, through our activities we have a positive impact beyond associates, also improving living conditions in communities. Thus, we can say that it is a model for generating differentiated value, having at its roots the DNA of sustainability. A phrase by Father Theodor Amstad, precursor of credit cooperativism in Brazil, summarizes this view: 13Our principles and Values ​​are based on cooperation between people, with a focus on the development of regions through the promotion of a virtuous cycle, in which resources continue to circulate in the cooperative's area of ​​activity. César Bochi President Director of Banco Cooperativo Sicredi “Not just working for myself, but for others or for the common good” As you can see, solidarity and responsibility towards society — two of the fundamental values ​​of cooperative activism — were already present since the first days of the movement in Brazil. We are very proud of the path we have taken and the trajectory we have built over the years. Knowing our history inspires us to continue taking new steps and generating impact on society, through the essence of cooperativism.

In addition: • We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and execute audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to substantiate our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations. 34 • Obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. • We evaluate the adequacy of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. • We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise signiﬁcant doubt in relation to the capacity continued rational operation of the Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we should call attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include modification to our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. • We evaluate the general presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the planned scope, timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our work.
