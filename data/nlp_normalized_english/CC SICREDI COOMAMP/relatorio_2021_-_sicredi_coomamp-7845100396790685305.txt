Good Reading! 4 Annual Report 2021 Sicredi Coomamp Message from the leadership The Brazilian economy grew by around 4.6% in 2021, according to data from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), overcoming the losses that occurred in 2020, when there was a downturn in the economy gave 3.9%. After collapsing in 2020, Brazil's Gross Domestic Product closed 2021 on a high, representing around R$8.7 trillion, a good recovery after the first year of the epidemic, and was the best result since 2010, the year in which the economy grew 7.5%. The same effect was felt in Brazilian cooperatives, which also grew. This jumped from 15.5 million (in 2019) to 17.2 million last year – registering a growth of around 11%, according to data from the “Brazilian Cooperativism Yearbook” launched by the OCB System in 2020. As highlighted by the president of the OCB System, Márcio Lopes de Freitas, the fact that cooperatives overcame themselves during one of the most complex years in history and present extremely positive results, for him it is further proof that cooperativism is even stronger in times of crisis. There are currently 4,868 cooperatives distributed across all states, operating in the seven branches of cooperativism, offering the market and the population quality products and services under the COOP brand. During the pandemic period and in view of the many companies that had their activities closed, cooperativism showed its strength even more, whether due to its initial connection with the community in which it operates or even its close dialogue with the agents responsible for the activities/services provided. Even so, the financial indicators of cooperativism also demonstrate the strength of the movement. In 2020, the total assets of the cooperatives that participated in the yearbook research reached the mark of R$655 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2019. Net equity was recorded at R$145 billion: 15% higher when compared to the previous year. In this scenario, Sicredi Coomamp in the credit sector is one of 755 Brazilian credit cooperatives, which are home to 11,966,563 members/members and generate 79,121 direct jobs, and which despite all the setbacks of the pandemic period continued to overcome adversities and distribute positive results. Certain of the advances we are making, especially in the benefits that are generated, we wish to continue this path of success, of generating wealth and sharing of results, promoting a more humane world with greater cooperation.2021 – The year of recovery João Leonardo Sousa Pires Leal President Director of Sicredi Coomamp5 Annual Report 2021 Sicredi Coomamp Our cooperative Sicredi Coomamp The year 2002 was marked by the beginning of the necessary measures for the constitution of our cooperative. After months of coordination, on October 7th the General Assembly of the Constitution of the first cooperative genuinely Maranhão credit: COOMAMP - Credit Cooperative for Members of Public Institutions of Legal Careers and Federal, State and Municipal Public Servants in São Luís (MA) and Surrounding Municipalities. On April 28, 2003, we opened our temporary headquarters, in the Capital Public Prosecutor's Office building and on May 2 of the same year, our first financial operation was completed. Since then, the cooperative has been growing and consolidating itself in the local scene. In 2011 we took an important step: we acquired our first own headquarters. On April 28th, COOMAMP inaugurated the new facilities of its administrative headquarters in Shopping Jaracaty (São Luís – MA). The new space, with 140m², started to operate in the basement of the shopping center with a structure that provided more comfort and convenience for employees and associates. In 2018, together with the other cooperatives in the Northeast, COOMAMP migrated to the Sicredi system, becoming is called Sicredi Coomamp. This affiliation gave more strength to credit cooperatives, as operating in the System increases the potential of cooperatives to carry out their activity in a market that has large financial institutions. That same year, on November 13th, we inaugurated the Renascença Agency and the new administrative headquarters facilities, both located in the Office Tower Building, in the Jardim Renascença neighborhood (São Luís – MA).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above adequately present, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of Sicredi Coomamp - Credit Union of Members of Public Institutions of Legal Careers and Federal, State and Municipal Public Servants in São Luís /MA and Surrounding Municipalities on December 31, 2021, the performance of its operations and its cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for these other information comprising the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 17 Annual Report 2021 Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for preparing and adequately presenting the financial statements in accordance with industry practices accounting standards adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, the matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Additionally: • We identify and We assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations. • We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls. 18 Annual Report 2021 Sicredi Coomamp • We assessed the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board. • We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity . If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity. • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.
