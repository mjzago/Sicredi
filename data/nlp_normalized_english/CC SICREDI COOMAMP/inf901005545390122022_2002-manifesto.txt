In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above fairly present, in all material respects, the position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and their respective cash flows for the year ended on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN).

Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section entitled “Auditor’s responsibilities for auditing the financial statements”. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion.

In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit or, otherwise, it appears to be materially distorted. If, based on the work performed, If we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for controls that it has determined to be necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless that the board intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken in together, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or in together, may influence, within a reasonable perspective, the economic decisions of users taken based on the aforementioned financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, we plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional false representations.

Cooperative. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the statements financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate.

We are a cooperative financial institution committed to the growth of our members and the development of the regions where we operate. We offer more than 300 financial products and services, ranging from current accounts and cards to investments, insurance, consortiums, card machines and 100% digital accounts, serving people physical, legal and rural producers. In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, from the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This is done through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In the year 2022 we saw a spike in inflation in Brazil and around the world, after the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with osfed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended the year 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of the increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and because of this, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In fact, the Central Bank ended the cycle high interest rate with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until mid-next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good growth of GDP in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the services sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the labor market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching a record decline and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase family default and debt, given the increase in credit and rising prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society. Throughout 2022, we were willing to meet the needs of members, negotiating credit lines, listening and leading a debate, within the Board of Directors, on the need to redeem capital , in case of emergency.

Capital Management Structure For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the ongoing process of: Capital management of institutions of the Sicredi System is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in capital management. Processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System.

The definition also includes the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties arising from activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using systemically established tools, methodologies and processes. Such processes are composed of a set of actions that aim to maintain at adequate levels the risks to which each institution is exposed. These are: • Internal standards containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the entire institution; • Identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation of operational risks; •Identification, collection and treatment of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk topics and internal controls for governance forums; • Dissemination of the risk management culture throughout the organization; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses resulting from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to evaluate, manage and monitor operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue delivering products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of their services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. VI - Liquidity Risk Understanding Liquidity Risk is essential for the sustainability of institutions that operate in the financial and capital markets and is associated with the institution's ability to finance commitments acquired at reasonable market prices and carry out your business plans with stable sources of financing. For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: •The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected, current and future obligations, including those arising from the commitment of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring significant losses; and •The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market. The liquidity risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support System entities in managing risk of liquidity.The processes and policies for managing market risk are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's market risk management processes include: • Clear rules for classifying the trading portfolio that guarantee the correct treatment of operations; • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to market risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's market risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of market risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform the calculation and measure risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the exposure to market risk of the System's institutions. V - Risk of variation in interest rates Interest on Instruments Classified in the Banking Portfolio (IRRBB) IRRBB is the risk, current or prospective, of the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the results or economic value of the institution, resulting from instruments classified in the banking portfolio. IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the size exposure to System risk.

The new accounting rule comes into force from January 1, 2025, with adjustments resulting from the application of the accounting criteria established by this standard recorded as a contra entry to the accumulated surplus or losses account, for the net value of tax effects. Among the requirements of the new standard is the need to develop an implementation plan. This plan was approved by the Board of Directors of Individual Cooperatives during the 2022 financial year. In compliance with the provisions of item II of the sole paragraph of article 76 of CMN Resolution No. 4,966/2021, we disclose below, in summary form, the plan for implementation of said regulation: a) Summary of the Implementation Plan: • Phase I (2022): Assessment and understanding of the impacts of the standard (analysis of Gaps); • Phase II (2022/2023): Design and specifications of solutions and methodologies; • Phase III (2023/2024): Systemic development, calculation engines, etc.; • Phase IV (2023/2024): Tests and implementations. We emphasize that in the event of issuance of complementary standards to CMN Resolution No. 4,966/21 by the Central Bank of Brazil, it will be necessary to review the implementation plan. Capital Margin consists of the institution's capital surplus to the requirements regulatory minimums and additional principal capital. NOTE 25 – INSURANCE CONTRACTED As of December 31, 2022, the insurance contracted is considered sufficient by management to cover possible losses related to the guarantee of values ​​and assets owned by the Cooperative. The risk assumptions adopted, given their nature, are not part of the scope of a financial statement audit and are consequently not examined by our independent auditors.
