Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities under such standards are described in the following section entitled “Auditor’s Responsibilities for Auditing Financial Statements.” We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Others information accompanying the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, Therefore, consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and for the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from distortion material, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessment of the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or not have no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process preparation of financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for auditing the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian standards and international auditing, always detects any existing relevant distortions. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise judgment professional and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether caused by fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to such risks, and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.3  We assessed the adequacy of the accounting policies used and their reasonableness of estimates accounting records and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy of the management's use of the going concern accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is material uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern Cooperative. If we conclude that there is material uncertainty, we must draw attention in our audit report to the respective disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner compatible with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Ferreira Neto Contador CRC-1SP192685/O-9Board of Directors and Board of DirectorsThe year 2021 was marked by recovery.

Through credit lines granted to members of cooperatives, we support the maintenance of economic activity in communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing the commitment with our mission to add income and contribute to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our traditional credit lines remained active, as well as the lines of emergency programs from the Government. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each individual's needs in resuming and maintaining their business. We continue to expand the offer of solutions in electronic means of service (ATMs, internet banking, application), which made many of our demands viable as these are complete channels that allow most operations to be carried out without the need to go to branches . We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. In parallel, We returned to operating in person at all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this relationship channel with our associates. During this period of recovery, we had lines of credit that met the needs of members. In a transparent manner, we were willing to listen to them and bring to debate within the Board of Directors the need to rescue capital in case of urgency.

a) Calculation of the result Income and expenditure, as well as revenue and expenses, are recorded monthly in accordance with the accrual regime, which establishes that income and expenditure and revenue and expenses must be included in the calculation of the results of the periods in which they occur, always simultaneously when they are correlated, regardless of receipt or payment, allocated proportionally according to the amounts of gross income from cooperative action and gross income from non-cooperative action, when not identified with each activity. The taxes due are determined and collected on the results of any operations carried out with non-cooperators (non-cooperative act). The results of these operations are taken to the account of the Technical, Educational and Social Assistance Fund - FATES, as provided for in Law No. 5,764/71. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Cooperative presented a net result of R$ (14) (2020 - R$ 16) referring to Non-Cooperative Acts. Authorization to complete these financial statements was granted by the Board of Directors on March 8 2022. NOTE 03 – SUMMARY OF MAIN PRACTICES The main accounting practices adopted to prepare the financial statements were: 12/31/2020 Adjustment 12/31/2020The financial statements were prepared and are being presented in accordance with the regulations issued by the National Monetary Council -CMN and the Central Bank of Brazil -BACEN, including CMN Resolution No. 4,818/20 and BCB Resolution No. 2/20 that regulated procedures for preparing and disclosing financial statements. The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System were also observed. -COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01,02,03,04,05,10,23,24,25,27,33 and 46) and legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Laws nº 4,595/64 and nº 5,764/71 , with amendments by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from error rectification adjustments in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as below: (a) Inflows from intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the inflows from intercooperative deposits were reclassified, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating income. The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and income, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and income from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating result Among the regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20 There was a change in the way in which statements of surpluses or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to construction or losses from non-operating income is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature in the account groups of other income and operating revenues and other expenditures and operating expenses, for the purpose of favoring the comparability of the financial statements. Execution of activities complies with the provisions of the relevant legislation, as well as official regulatory acts, the bylaws, and Sicredi's internal rules. As of December 31, 2021, Sicredi is organized by 108 affiliated Credit Cooperatives, which operate with a service network of 2,127 points, of which the Cooperative operates in 2 service points. The structure also has five Regional Centers – shareholders of Sicredi Participações S.A. (“SicrediPar”) – the Confederation of Cooperativas doSicredi (“Confederação Sicredi”), a Foundation together with Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. (“Bank”). The Cooperative is an integral part of the Credit Cooperative Guarantee Fund (FGCoop), a non-profit civil association, with legal personality under private law with national coverage, as per Annex I to the resolution of the National Monetary Council ("CMN") No. 4,284, of November 5, 2013. OFGCoop has purpose is to provide a guarantee for credits in cases of decree intervention or extrajudicial liquidation of an associated institution, up to a limit of R$250 per member (CPF/CNPJ), as well as contracting assistance, financial support and liquidity operations with these institutions. The Cooperative is also an integral part of Sicredi Fundos Garantidores, a non-profit company whose creation of reserves comes from monthly and extraordinary contributions from cooperatives associated with the fund whose purpose is to ensure the credibility and solvency of its associated. According to the rules established in the Guarantee Fund Regulations, monthly contributions are determined by the sum of two installments: fixed portion, related to the objective of each Fund; and variable portion, relating to the risk attributed to the System (considers levels of liquidity, capital margin and use of security devices).
