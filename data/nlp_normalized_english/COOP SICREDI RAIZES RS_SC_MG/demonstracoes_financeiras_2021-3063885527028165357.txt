Our opinion contains no reservations related to this matter. Other information accompanying the financial statements and auditor's report A The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on that report. In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, consider whether that report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained from the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there is a material distortion in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The management is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen and the internal controls that it determined as necessary to allow the preparation of financial statements free from material distortion, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error . When preparing the financial statements, the board is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in the preparation of financial statements unless the board of directors intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid the closure of operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing the financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities for audit of financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, always detects possible distortions existing relevant data. Misstatements may arise from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed, in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentation.  We obtained an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit to plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by the board.  We conclude on the adequacy the use, by the board, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubt in relation to the Cooperative's operational continuity capacity. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a change in our opinion, if disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer remain in operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of adequate presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other things, the scope and timing of planned audit work and significant audit findings, including significant deficiencies in internal controls that may have been identified during our work.

Even with the pandemic scenario, which lasted throughout the year, Sicredi kept the virtuous cycle of cooperativism alive. Through credit lines granted to cooperative members, we support the maintenance of the economic activity of communities in the regions where we operate, reinforcing our commitment to our mission of adding income and contributing to improving the quality of life of members and society. Our Traditional credit lines continued to be active, as did emergency program lines from the Government. And, as is characteristic of our business model, we closely monitor the reality of our associates and the regions where we are present, which made it possible to expand the offer of options suited to each person's needs in resuming and maintaining business. We continue to expand the offer of electronic customer service solutions (automated teller machines, internet banking, app), making many of our demands viable, since these are complete channels that allow the majority of operations to be carried out without the need to go to agencies. We also have telephone channels that can be used to answer questions and provide assistance via WhatsApp, which brings even more agility to many requests. At the same time, we returned to operating face-to-face in all branches, following the protocols of the health authorities and maintaining this channel of relationship with our associates. During this period of recovery, we highlight the following administrative facts: opening of our agency in the municipality of Tunápolis (SC); signing of agreements with eight city halls in our area of ​​operation to transfer payroll to municipal public employees; opening a current account for Individual members that is 100% digital, without the need for the member to go to the branch; Zero Interest program for MEIs in our municipalities area of ​​activity in Santa Catarina; participation in Pronampe; and individual analysis of the needs of each member when extending credit operations. On another front, we work on numerous initiatives to contribute to the development of local communities. Among them we can highlight our participation in the traditional Cooperation Day (C-Day), celebrated on July 3rd, when we carried out 29 actions aimed at the needs of each municipality where we operate, impacting 31,445 people. In addition In addition, we invested R$700 thousand in 54 projects in the Support Social Fund and in 13 hospitals in our area of ​​operation, benefiting more than 375 thousand people. In the area of ​​education, we impacted 1,112 students in the “AUnião Faz a Vida” program and developed entrepreneurship and leadership in eight School Cooperatives, which involve around 250 students in five municipalities. We also continue to operate the “People Who Cooperate Care” and “I Cooperate with the Local Economy” movements, which helped us take care of people and communities, reaffirming the strength of cooperativism as an engine capable of contributing to the continuity of economic activity in the country.

The regulatory standards contained in the Accounting Plan of the Institutions of the National Financial System - COSIF, the Accounting Pronouncements approved by BACEN (CPCs 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 33 and 46) and the legislation applied to credit cooperatives, especially the provisions of Law nº4 .595/64 and nº5.764/71, as amended by Complementary Law nº 130/09. Re-presentation of comparative figures: Management is re-presenting the balances of the 2020 financial statements, presented for comparison purposes, resulting from adjustments correction of error in accordance with the provisions of CPC 23, as follows: (a) Inflows of intercooperative deposits in the statements of surpluses and losses In 2021, the reclassification of inflows of intercooperative deposits was carried out, for comparison purposes, recorded on December 31, 2020 as other inflows and operating revenues . The cooperative understands that the values ​​applied to the Centrals via Financial Centralization are not characterized as other operating income and revenues, as previously adopted, and should be considered as income and revenue from financial intermediation. In this operation, the amounts captured in centralization will be applied by the Bank to the market, generating revenue from financial intermediation, and remunerated to the centers via centralization. As it is an applied treasury resource, the nature of this revenue is characterized as Financial Intermediation, therefore this classification is the most appropriate. (b) Non-operating income Between The regulatory changes resulting from BCB Resolution No. 2/20 resulted in a change in the way in which the statements of works or losses were presented. The cooperative understands that the balance relating to non-operating income or losses is no longer an integral part of this statement, as previously adopted. In this way, the cooperative reclassified the balances by nature into groups of accounts of other operating income and income and other operating expenditure and expenses, for purposes prejudice the comparability of financial statements. (c) Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the cash flow statements Additionally, reclassifications were identified related to changes in the decentralization model where Cooperatives began to invest part of their short-term resources in fixed income and multimarket funds, which have immediate convertibility in a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of value, making it possible to classify as cash and cash equivalents in accordance with the premises of CPC 03.

The definition includes, also, the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by the institution, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensation for damages to third parties resulting from the activities carried out by the institution. Operational risk management is carried out jointly between the Bank, Centrals and Individual Cooperatives. These entities are responsible for complying with internal and external regulations, using tools, methodologies and systemically established processes. Such processes are made up of a set of actions that aim to maintain the risks to which each institution is exposed at adequate levels. These are:I - Capital Management Structure For the purposes of current legislation, Capital Management is defined as the continuous process of: • Monitoring and controlling the capital held by the Institution; • Assessment of the need for capital to face the risks to which the Institution is subject; • Planning goals and capital needs, considering the Institution's strategic objectives. The capital management of the Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing the capital. The processes and policies for capital management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. The Sicredi System's capital management processes include: •Mechanisms that enable the identification, assessment and monitoring of relevant risks incurred by the institution, including risks not covered by the requirements legal minimum capital; •Capital targets at levels above minimum legal requirements and that reflect the system's risk appetite, aiming to maintain capital to support the risks incurred and ensure business growth in a sustainable and efficient manner; • Capital Plan for each System Institution, consistent with strategic planning, covering a minimum horizon of three years; • Stress tests and assessment of their impacts on capital; • Management reports periodic reports on the adequacy of capital for the board of directors and the board of directors; The guarantees provided include operations with resources received from financial institutions and passed on to members via Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A., in which the Cooperative is an intermediary and joint guarantor under a signed contract between the parts. The amounts are mostly made up of Finame and BNDES programs. NOTE 28 – RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The System Sicredi considers risk management to be a priority in the conduct of its activities and business, adopting practices in absolute accordance with the precepts of the Basel Accords. In this way, it has specialized areas for the management of these risks, centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi S.A. Among the main risks managed by the institution, the highlights are the Capital Management Structure, Operational Risk, business continuity, Market, Interest Rate Variations, Liquidity, Credit, Socio-Environmental, Compliance Risk and Information Security Risk, the main aspects of which are presented below: Co-obligations in credit assignments 40 70 Total 181,411 167,341 Guarantees provided by the Cooperative in the form of guarantee, guarantee or other co-obligations are made up as follows: 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Beneficiaries of guarantees provided 181,371 167,271 Recurring income 25,641 53,405 35,712 NOTE 27 – COOBLIGATIONS IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED Result before allocations 25,641 53,591 36,578 Revenue from credit assignment - (186) - NOTE 26 – NON-RECURRING RESULT 2nd half of 2021 (Unaudited)12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Resources received Sicredi Guarantee Funds (866) - - Total 12,485 21,596 16,939 Interest and commissions 40                                                      57                                                         53  Outras despesas operacionais                                                       288                                                    935                                                       417 Operação com cartões (emissão, postagem, processamento, demais)                                                       959                                                1.903 1.522  Risco operacional                                                       113                                                    325                                                       322                                                       428  Provisões para garantias financeiras prestadas                                                    1.298                                                1.903                                                   1.929 Encargos da administração financeira                                                            1                                                        1                                                           2  Repasse Administradora de Cartões                                                             -                                                         -                                                         67 Cooperativa Central Sicredi Sul/Sudeste                                                       340 707                                                       730 Contribuição Sicredi Fundos Garantidores                                                          68                                                    155                                                       330  Contribuição Confederação Sicredi                                                    4.329                                                8.059                                                   7.026 Contribuições Cooperatives 75 148 216 2nd half of 2021 (Unaudited) 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 (Represented) Discounts granted in renegotiation and credit 3,525 4,843 1,891 NOTE 25 – OTHERS OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND EXPENSES This document was digitally signed by Aline Thiesen, Marcelo Junior Altissimo and Eduardo Netto Sarubbi.

Understanding Liquidity Risk is essential for the sustainability of institutions that operate in the financial and capital markets and is associated with the institution's ability to finance commitments acquired at reasonable market prices and carry out its business plans with stable sources of financing. For this purpose, liquidity risk is defined as: •The possibility of the institution not being able to efficiently honor its expected and unexpected obligations, current and future ones, including those arising from the binding of guarantees, without affecting its daily operations and without incurring significant losses; and •The possibility of the institution not being able to negotiate a position at market price, due to its large size in relation to the volume normally traded or due to some discontinuity in the market. Liquidity risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the extent of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's entities in managing liquidity risk. The processes and policies for managing liquidity risk are established following the criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each System Institution. The Sicredi System's liquidity risk management processes include: • Definition of processes to identify, evaluate, monitor and control exposure to liquidity risk over different time horizons; • The establishment of processes for tracking and reporting compliance with liquidity risk appetite and at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Definition of fundraising strategies that provide adequate diversification of sources of resources and due dates; • Definition of a liquidity contingency plan, regularly updated, that establishes responsibilities and procedures to face liquidity stress situations; • Periodic carrying out of stress tests with short and long-term scenarios. The Sicredi System's market risk management processes include: • Clear rules for classifying the trading portfolio that guarantee the correct treatment of operations; • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to market risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's market risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of market risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems to perform calculations and measure risks, considering the complexity of products and the extent of exposure to market risk of institutions of the system. V - Risk of Variation in Interest Rates on Instruments Classified in the Banking Portfolio (IRRBB) IRRBB is the risk, current or prospective, of the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the results or economic value of the institution, resulting from instruments classified in the banking portfolio. IRRBB risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of products and the extent of exposure to System risk. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing IRRBB risk. To measure and control this risk at Sicredi, the economic value (EVE) and financial intermediation results (NII) approaches are used. The Sicredi System defines the rules for calculating the risk of variation in the interest rate of operations in line with the market practices and the requirements of current regulations. The processes for managing IRRBB risk in the Sicredi System include: • Procedures designed to measure, monitor and maintain exposure to IRRBB risk at levels considered acceptable by the Institution; • Processes designed to monitor and report adherence to the Institution's IRRBB risk appetite in relation to its capital; • Definition of the IRRBB risk methodologies to be applied; • Systems for perform the calculation and measure the risks, considering the complexity of the products and the size of the IRRBB risk exposure of the System's institutions. VI - Liquidity RiskThe Business Continuity Management system structured in Sicredi includes: • Business Continuity Management Standard; • Business impact analysis - BIAs; • Business and IT disaster recovery strategies; • Operational and IT continuity plans. Finally, Sicredi makes available to all its agencies a manual model of continuity of activities of agencies, which allows the preparation of a customized document, in order to meet the main scenarios of interruption of activities”. IV - Market Risk Market risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from fluctuations in market values ​​and deposits held by a financial institution. This definition includes operations subject to the risks of exchange rate variation, interest rates, prices of shares and commodity prices. Market risk management of Sicredi System institutions is centralized at Banco Cooperativo Sicredi, through a structure compatible with the nature of the operations, the complexity of the products and the dimension of the System's risk exposure. The centralized structure is responsible for establishing the processes, policies and systems that support the System's institutions in managing market risk. Processes and policies for market risk management are established following the minimum criteria of current regulations, aligned with the best market practices, and approved by the competent authorities of each institution in the System. • Internal regulations containing rules, roles and responsibilities regarding operational risk management disseminated to the institution's personnel; • Identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of operational risks; • Storage, monitoring and investigation of operational losses, aiming to maintain them at levels considered acceptable by the institution; • Periodic and structured reports on relevant operational risk and internal control topics to governance forums; • Implementation and maintenance of training programs on the Institution's risk and control culture; • Periodic stress tests for operational risk scenarios; •Procedures that aim to ensure the continuity of the institution's activities and limit losses arising from the interruption of critical business processes, including impact analyzes and periodic tests of continuity plans. Furthermore, a set of procedures has been implemented to assess, manage and monitor the operational risk arising from outsourced services relevant to the regular functioning of the institution. III - Business Continuity Risk Business Continuity Management (BCM) is the organization's ability to continue delivering products and/or services at a previously defined acceptable level, after interruption incidents. Sicredi has a structure to respond appropriately to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the most critical processes of the System's centralizing entities, in the event of the occurrence of events that cause the interruption of its services, thus preserving the interests of all parties involved. Through a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), the institution's main business processes as well as the IT services that support these processes and, thus, the business continuity strategies adopted are defined. Sicredi's Integrated Risk Management Policy and Business Continuity Standard set out the basic principles and structure necessary to ensure adequate response to recovery, restoration and agreed levels of availability for the entities' most critical processes.
