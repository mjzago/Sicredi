In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present adequately, in all material aspects, the equity and financial position of the Cooperative as of December 31, 2022, the performance of its operations and its respective cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN). Basis for opinion Our audit was conducted in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards. Our responsibilities, in accordance with such standards, are described in the following section, entitled Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of financial statements. We are independent in relation to the Cooperative, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set out in the Accountant's Code of Professional Ethics and in the professional standards issued by the Federal Accounting Council, and we comply with other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support our opinion. Other information that accompanies the financial statements and the auditor's report The Cooperative's board of directors is responsible for this other information that comprises the Management Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion on this report.Setor Hoteleiro Sul -Quadra 06 Set A - Block A 1st floor - room 105 70316-000 - Brasília - DF - Brazil Tel: +55 61 2104-0100 ey.com.brIn connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Report of management and, in doing so, consider whether such report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, If we conclude that there is a material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to communicate this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Board and governance responsibilities for the financial statements The board is responsible for the preparation and adequate presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices adopted in Brazil applicable to institutions authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), and for internal controls which it determined to be necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Cooperative's ability to continue operating, disclosing, when applicable, matters related to its operational continuity and the use of this accounting basis in preparing the financial statements, unless that the director intends to liquidate the Cooperative or cease its operations, or has no realistic alternative to avoid closing operations. Those responsible for the Cooperative's governance are those responsible for supervising the process of preparing financial statements. Auditor's Responsibilities for Auditing the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, and issue an audit report containing our opinion. Reasonable security is a high level of security, but not a guarantee that the audit carried out in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards always detects any existing relevant misstatements. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material when, individually or collectively, they may influence, within a reasonable perspective, users' economic decisions taken based on said financial statements. As part of the audit performed in accordance with Brazilian and international auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. In addition:  We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, regardless of whether caused by fraud or error, plan and We perform audit procedures in response to such risks and obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, as fraud may involve the act of circumventing internal controls, collusion, forgery, omission or intentional misrepresentations.  We have obtained an understanding of internal controls audit-relevant for We plan audit procedures appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Cooperative's internal controls.  We evaluate the adequacy of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates and respective disclosures made by management.  We conclude on the adequacy of the use, by management, of the operational continuity accounting basis and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether there is relevant uncertainty in relation to events or conditions that may raise significant doubts regarding the Cooperative's ability to continue operating. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we should draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or include a modification of our opinion if the disclosures are inadequate. Our conclusions are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may lead the Cooperative to no longer maintain operational continuity.  We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events in a manner consistent with the objective of fair presentation. We communicate with those responsible for governance regarding, among other aspects, the scope planned, the time of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identified during our work. Brasília, February 22, 2023. ERNST & YOUNG Auditores Independentes S/S Ltda. CRC SP-015199/F Renata Zanotta Calçada Contadora CRC-RS062793/O-8During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: we opened our first branches in Minas Gerais, in the municipalities of Olhos D’Água, Bocaiuva and Curvelo; we formalized agreements with 12 city halls in our area of ​​operation to transfer payroll to municipal public employees; we strengthened the opening of current accounts for individual members 100% digitally, without the need for the member to go to the branch; We raised funds and offered credit so that members could grow and develop, encouraging local commerce and strengthening the region's economy.

In our operating model, the resources raised are reinvested in the region. In this way, we positively impact the community, stimulating income generation and sustainable growth. Our members are the true owners of the business, with the right to participate in the results and decisions of the cooperatives through voting. During this period, we highlight the following administrative facts: Management Report Our journey completed its 120 years in Brazil in 2022, starting with the founding of the first credit cooperative, on December 28, 1902. The objective of the first cooperative was to improve the living conditions of the people who lived in that community and it remains current, being part of our purpose and our actions. Collaborating with the development and social transformation of the regions where we operate has been one of our premises since our foundation. This occurs through initiatives that deliver a differentiated, cooperative relationship, and that reflect the values ​​of cooperativism, such as solidarity, transparency, responsibility and sustainability. Economic Scenario In 2022 we saw an increase in inflation in Brazil and around the world, following the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which raised the prices of several commodities. In response to this scenario, Central Banks around the world decided to adopt a monetary tightening stance, starting the global interest rate hike cycle. The highlight was the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the USA) which began its interest rate hike cycle in March this year with fed funds in the range between 0.00% and 0.25% and ended 2022 in the range between 4.25% - 4.50%, and interest rates should continue to rise in 2023. The effect of The increase in interest rates in advanced economies contributed to the repricing of risky assets by the market and the increase in the prospect of a reduction in global growth. In Brazil, the monetary tightening cycle began at the beginning of 2021, and as a result, inflation data already points to a disinflationary trend. In In fact, the Central Bank ended the interest rate hike cycle with Selic at 13.75% p.a. and should remain at this high level until the middle of next year. The effect of the reopening on economic activity influenced the good GDP growth in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the advancement of the service sectors. However, economic activity is already showing signs of accommodation as the effect of the reopening wears off and the effects of restrictive monetary policy become more evident. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the income status of families. On the one hand, the improvement in the job market contributed to income growth, with the employed population reaching record growth and the unemployment rate rising from 11.2% in January 2022 to 8.2% in the reading of October, on the other hand, the entry of these workers was accompanied by an increase in defaults and household debt, given the increase in the cost of credit and the rise in prices. Finally, the year 2022 ends with a new president elected and concerns about the fiscal policy that will be implemented in the coming years. We believe that we can contribute to the development of a more prosperous society Recognitions For more than 10 years, we have appeared in some of the most recognized national rankings and awards, such as: Melhores e Maiores, from Exame Magazine, Valor 1000, from Valor Econômico, Melhores Emp resources to Work, from Você S/A Magazine, rankings from the Central Bank and BNDES. In 2022 we had our corporate rating raised by Moody’s. Sicredi achieved the agency's highest rating, going from AA+ to AAA, proving that it has one of the safest and least risky credit profiles assessed by the risk rating agency. Furthermore, we were recognized as the 4th best Financial Institution in a ranking published by Forbes Magazine, the same one that cites us as the best financial institution in Brazil in terms of physical and digital service.

When this is the case, the recoverable value is calculated to check whether there is a loss. When there is a loss, it is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value, which is the greater of the net sales price and the value in use of an asset.j) Investments They are stated at cost of acquisition, refer to participation in companies in the Sicredi System, adjusted by provision for losses when applicable. k) Fixed assets in use Corresponds to rights that have as their object tangible assets intended for the maintenance of activities or exercised for this purpose.

These assets do not depreciate and are measured at fair value in accordance with the criteria established by CPC 46, which was approved by CMN Resolution No. 4,748/19. •Own: represent the assets owned by the cooperative which are not used in the performance of social activity, being available for immediate sale and whose disposal is highly probable within a maximum period of one year. • Received from third parties: represent goods received as a gift in payment of debts, not intended for personal use. i) Other current and long-term assets (non-current) Stated at acquisition cost, including, when applicable, income earned and pro-rata die monetary variations incurred and exchange rate variations, deducted from the corresponding provisions for losses or adjustment to market value and income to be appropriated.g) Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk The provision for expected losses associated with credit risk is based on the analysis of operations and takes into account the economic situation, the past experience, the specific and global risks of the portfolios, considering the provisioning criteria, defined in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00, associated with the assessments carried out by the Administration, in determining credit risks.e) Inter-financial relations – financial centralization Financial centralization comprises the cooperative's cash surpluses not invested in its activities, which are centralized through inter-financial transfers to the Central Cooperative. These amounts are invested in the financial market and/or lent to affiliated cooperatives to finance their activities and have immediate liquidity and monthly remuneration. f) Credit operations These are stated at cost plus income earned. Credit operations are classified according to Management's analysis regarding the level of risk, considering the economic situation and the specific risks in relation to the operations, debtors and guarantors, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and nº 2,697/00. The updating of credit operations due within 59 days is recorded in income from credit operations, and from the 60th day, in income to be appropriated. Operations classified as level <H= remain in this classification for six months, when they are written off against the existing provision and controlled, for at least five years, in clearing accounts, no longer appearing on the balance sheet.d) Securities and securities The portfolio is made up of fixed income securities, variable income securities and investment funds, which are presented at cost plus of income earned up to the balance sheet date, adjusted to the respective market values, as applicable. Accounting estimates are determined by Management, considering factors and assumptions established based on judgment, which are reviewed every six months. Significant items subject to these estimates and assumptions include provisions for expected losses associated with credit risk, adjustment of assets to probable realizable or recoverable value, provisions for contingencies, among others. The settlement of transactions involving these estimates may result in divergent values ​​due to inaccuracies inherent in the process of determining them. I - Provision for expected losses associated with credit risk: In addition to observing the requirements for establishing a provision due to delay in payment of a principal installment or transaction charges, the provision is calculated based on Management's judgment regarding the risk level, considering the economic situation, the specific risks in relation to the operation, debtors and guarantors, delay periods and the economic group, observing the parameters established in CMN Resolutions No. 2,682/99 and No. 2,697/00. The details of the provision for losses are presented in the Credit Operations note; II - Provision for civil, tax and labor risks: Based on loss prognoses assessed by Management, constituting a provision for fiscal, civil, tax and labor demands through legal assessments.

Contingent assets with probable success are only disclosed in an explanatory note; •Contingent liabilities are provisioned when losses are assessed as probable and the amounts involved can be measured with sufficient certainty. Contingent liabilities assessed as possible losses are disclosed, and those not measurable with sufficient certainty and as remote losses are not provisioned and/ or disclosed; • Legal obligations are recorded as enforceable, regardless of the assessment of the probabilities of success. r) Main accounting judgments and estimates Income Tax (IRPJ) and Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL) affect the positive result in non-cooperative acts. The provision corresponds to the current rates for IRPJ (15%, plus an additional 10%) and the CSLL is 16%, in compliance with Provisional Measure No. 1,115, published on 29 of April 2022, which increased the rate by one percentage point and taking effect during the period from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
